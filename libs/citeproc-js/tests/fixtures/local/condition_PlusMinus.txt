This test supports a proposal for extending CSL's conditional attributes.
The proposal introduces two new nodes and associated schema adjustments:

  * A cs:conditions element, as an optional first child of cs:if or cs:else-if,
    with a sole match attribute. When cs:conditions is used, its parent (cs:if 
    or cs:else-if) must have no attributes. Only cs:condition elements are permitted
    as children of cs:condition, and there must be at least one such child. 

  * A cs:condition element, with the same attributes as cs:if or cs:else-if.

The proposal also introduces a new value "nand" for the match attribute.

Under the proposal, conditional evaluation would take place as
follows:

  (1) cs:if and cs:else-if elements with attributes process exactly as under the
      current schema and specification.

  (2) cs:if and cs:else-if element with no attributes apply the conditions
      provided by the immediate cs:conditions child and its cs:condition
      children. The cs:condition children are evaluated first, according
      to the same logic as cs:if and cs:else-if. The results are then
      combined according to the match element on cs:conditions, returning
      a single boolean result for the parent cs:fi or cs:else-if element.

This change makes it possible to reduce the bulk of CSL code. As one example,
the construct below is found in several styles in the CSL repository:

    <macro name="year-date">
      <choose>
        <if type="webpage">
          <choose>
            <if variable="issued">
              <date variable="issued">
                <date-part name="year"/>
              </date>
            </if>
            <else>
              <date variable="accessed">
                <date-part name="year"/>
              </date>
            </else>
          </choose>
        </if>
        <else>
          <date variable="issued">
            <date-part name="year"/>
          </date>
        </else>
      </choose>
    </macro>

What the code does is to print the "accessed" date if the item is a
webpage and has no "issued" date, and otherwise to print the "issued"
date, regardless of item type. A nested cs:choose statement is needed,
because negative and positive conditions cannot be declared together
on the same cs:if or cs:else-if element.

With the proposed syntax, the code sample above can be rewritten as a
single cs:choose statement:

    <macro name="year-date">
      <choose>
        <if>
          <conditions match="all">
            <condition type="webpage" match="all"/>
            <condition variable="issued" match="none"/>
          </conditions>
          <date variable="accessed">
            <date-part name="year"/>
          </date>
        </if>
        <else>
          <date variable="issued">
            <date-part name="year"/>
          </date>
        </else>
      </choose>
    </macro>

>>===== RESULT =====>>
Item One is not an ARTICLE-JOURNAL, and has an EDITION
Item Two is a BOOK, but has no EDITION
Item Three is a CHAPTER, and has an AUTHOR
Item Four is an ARTICLE-JOURNAL with both VOLUME and ISSUE, but one of them is non-numeric
Item Five is an ARTICLE-JOURNAL with both VOLUME and ISSUE, and both of them are numeric
