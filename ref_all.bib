The model, which combines segmentation by keywords and pattern matching techniques, was implemented using PHP, MySQL, JavaScript and HTML. The system was tested with 40 randomly selected PDF documents (mainly theses). An evaluation of the system was done using standard criteria measures namely precision, recall, accuracy and F-measure. The results show that the model is relatively effective for the task of metadata extraction, especially for theses and dissertations. A combination of machine learning with these rule-based methods will be explored in the future for better results. 10.1177/0165551509105195",

Suitable for use as a textbook or for self-study by professionals, it concentrates on undergraduate-level fundamental concepts and techniques that will enable readers to proceed with building applications on their own. It includes exercises, project descriptions, and annotated references to relevant online materials. A Semantic Web Primer is the only available book on the Semantic Web to include a systematic treatment of the different languages (XML, RDF, OWL, and rules) and technologies (explicit metadata, ontologies, and logic and inference) that are central to Semantic Web development. The book also examines such crucial related topics as ontology engineering and application scenarios.<br /> <br /> After an introductory chapter, topics covered in succeeding chapters include XML and related technologies that support semantic interoperability; RDF and RDF Schema, the standard data model for machine-processable semantics; and OWL, the W3C-approved standard for a Web ontology language more extensive than RDF Schema; rules, both monotonic and nonmonotonic, in the framework of the Semantic Web; selected application domains and how the Semantic Web would benefit them; the development of ontology-based systems; and current debates on key issues and predictions for the future.}",

The resemblance can be estimated using a fixed size ” sketch” for each document. For a large collection of documents (say hundreds of millions) the size of this sketch is of the order of a few hundred bytes per document. However, for efficient large scale web indexing it is not necessary to determine the actual resemblance value: it suffices to determine whether newly encountered documents are duplicates or near-duplicates of documents already indexed. In other words, it suffices to determine whether the resemblance is above a certain threshold. In this talk we show how this determination can be made using a ” sample” of less than 50 bytes per document. The basic approach for computing resemblance has two aspects: first, resemblance is expressed as a set (of strings) intersection problem, and second, the relative size of intersections is evaluated by a process of random sampling that can be done independently for each document. The process of estimating the relative size of intersection of sets and the threshold test discussed above can be applied to arbitrary sets, and thus might be of independent interest. The algorithm for filtering near-duplicate documents discussed here has been successfully implemented and has been used for the last three years in the context of the AltaVista search engine.",

Much work has already been done within the learning technology community to assure metadata quality, focused on the development of metadata standards, specifications and vocabularies and their implementation within repositories. The metadata creation process has thus far been largely overlooked. There has been an assumption that metadata creation will be straightforward and that where machines cannot generate metadata effectively, authors of learning materials will be the most appropriate metadata creators. However, repositories are reporting difficulties in obtaining good quality metadata from their contributors, and it is becoming apparent that the issue of metadata creation warrants attention. This paper surveys the growing body of evidence, including three UK-based case studies, scopes the issues surrounding human-generated metadata creation and identifies questions for further investigation. Collaborative creation of metadata by resource authors and metadata specialists, and the design of tools and processes, are emerging as key areas for deeper research.

Whilst the amount of digitised information is constantly increasing, so too is the pace of progress in information technology, resulting in obsolescence of the software and hardware required to access and view digital information. Despite many organisations recognising this threat and the resulting need for preservation action, more work is required to effectively address the issue. We present in this article a framework for the long-term digital preservation of 3-D data. This framework is based on two pertinent preservation practices, emulation and metadata which ensure that the authenticity and usability, respectively, of a preserved digital object remain intact through time. An evaluation of our framework is presented which illustrates the viability of our approach in retaining accessibility, authenticity and usability for future end users.",

The CIDOC CRM is now in the process to become an International Organization for Standardization (ISO) standard. This article justifies in detail the methodology and design by functional requirements and gives examples of its contents. The CIDOC CRM analyzes the common conceptualizations behind data and metadata structures to support data transformation, mediation, and merging. It is argued that such ontologies are property-centric, in contrast to terminological systems, and should be built with different methodologies. It is demonstrated that ontological and epistemological arguments are equally important for an effective design, in particular when dealing with knowledge from the past in any domain. It is assumed that the presented methodology and the upper level of the ontology are applicable in a far wider domain.",

A complete and extensible ontology that expresses the basic concepts that are common across a variety of domains and can provide the basis for specialization into domain-specific concepts and vocabularies, is essential for well-defined mappings between domain-specific knowledge representations (i.e., metadata vocabularies) and the subsequent building of a variety of services such as cross-domain searching, browsing, data mining and knowledge extraction. This paper describes the results of a series of three workshops held in 2001 and 2002 which brought together representatives from the cultural heritage and digital library communities with the goal of harmonizing their knowledge perspectives and producing a core ontology. The knowledge perspectives of these two communities were represented by the CIDOC/CRM [31], an ontology for information exchange in the cultural heritage and museum community, and the ABC ontology [33], a model for the exchange and integration of digital library information. This paper describes the mediation process between these two different knowledge biases and the results of this mediation -- the harmonization of the ABC and CIDOC/CRM ontologies, which we believe may provide a useful basis for information integration in the wider scope of the involved communities.",

This makes comparison of DLs extremely difficult, promotes ad-hoc development, and impedes interoperability. In this paper we propose a formal ontology for DLs that defines the fundamental concepts, relationships, and axiomatic rules that govern the DL domain, therefore providing a frame of reference for the discussion of essential concepts of DL design and construction. The ontology is an axiomatic, formal treatment of DLs, which distinguishes it from other approaches that informally define a number of architectural variants. The process of construction of the ontology was guided by 5S, a formal framework for digital libraries. To test its expressibility we have used the ontology to create a taxonomy of DL services and to reason about issues of reusability, extensibility, and composability. Some practical applications of the ontology are also described including: the definition of a digital library services taxonomy, the proposal of a modeling language for digital libraries, and the specification of quality metrics to evaluate digital libraries. We also demonstrate how to use the ontology to formally describe DL architectures and to prove some properties about them, thus helping to further validate the ontology.",

Ontological engineering refers to the set of activities concerning the ontology development process, the ontology life cycle, the methods and methodologies for building ontologies, and the tool suites and languages that support them. During the last decade, increasing attention has been focused on ontologies. Ontologies are now widely used in knowledge engineering, artificial intelligence and computer science; in applications related to areas such as knowledge management, natural language processing, e-commerce, intelligent information integration, bio-informatics, education; and in new emerging fields like the semantic web. The book presents the major issues of ontological engineering and describes the most outstanding ontologies currently available. It covers the practical aspects of selecting and applying methodologies, languages, and tools for building ontologies. Ontological Engineering will be of great value to students and researchers, and to developers who want to integrate ontologies in their information systems. }",

The top level Web page for each resource, from a sample of 29 resources obtained from National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS), was submitted to both generators. Results indicate that extraction processing algorithms can contribute to useful automatic metadata generation. Results also indicate that harvesting metadata from META tags created by humans can have a positive impact on automatic metadata generation. The study identifies several ways in which automatic metadata generation applications can be improved and highlights several important areas of research. The conclusion is that integrating extraction of harvesting methods will be the best approach to creating optimal metadata, and more research is needed to identify when to apply which method.",

	abstract = "In this article, we elaborate on the meaning of quality in digital libraries (DLs) by proposing a model that is deeply grounded in a formal framework for digital libraries: 5S (Streams, Structures, Spaces, Scenarios, and Societies). For each major DL concept in the framework we formally define a number of dimensions of quality and propose a set of numerical indicators for those quality dimensions. In particular, we consider key concepts of a minimal DL: catalog, collection, digital object, metadata specification, repository, and services. Regarding quality dimensions, we consider: accessibility, accuracy, completeness, composability, conformance, consistency, effectiveness, efficiency, extensibility, pertinence, preservability, relevance, reliability, reusability, significance, similarity, and timeliness. Regarding measurement, we consider characteristics like: response time (with regard to efficiency), cost of migration (with respect to preservability), and number of service failures (to assess reliability). For some key DL concepts, the (quality dimension, numerical indicator) pairs are illustrated through their application to a number of ” real-world” digital libraries. We also discuss connections between the proposed dimensions of DL quality and an expanded version of a workshop's consensus view of the life cycle of information in digital libraries. Such connections can be used to determine when and where quality issues can be measured, assessed, and improved -- as well as how possible quality problems can be prevented, detected, and eliminated.",

By sharing a set of ontologies, it is possible to make collections semantically interoperable, and provide the museum visitors with intelligent content-based search and browsing services to the global collection base. The architecture underlying MuseumFinland separates generic search and browsing services from the underlying application dependent schemas and metadata by a layer of logical rules. As a result, the portal creation framework and software developed has been applied successfully to other domains as well. MuseumFinland got the Semantic Web Challence Award (second prize) in 2004.",

In this paper, a novel message conversion system is proposed, which functions by separating the heterogeneous mapping information from the mapping rules of the metadata, in order to overcome the drawbacks of the existing metadata gateway methods. The proposed system controls the standardized data elements dynamically based on the Metadata Registry (MDR), which is one of the most important elements of the ISO/IEC 11179 standard. The problems associated with adding supplementary metadata are resolved, since the standard provides for incorporating additional data elements created in the future. MSDL is defined as a protocol which can be used for exchanging messages between heterogeneous systems, and which ensures that all of the systems have their own independent metadata schemas. 10.1177/0165551505055403",

This paper presents the Dryad repository's metadata best practice balancing of these two needs. The paper reviews background work exploring the meaning of science, characterizing data, and highlighting data curation metadata challenges. The Dryad repository is introduced, and the initiative's metadata best practice and underlying rationales are described. Dryad's metadata approach includes two prongs: one addressing the long-term goal to align with the Semantic Web via a metadata application profile; and another addressing the immediate need to make content available in DSpace via an extensible markup language (XML) schema. The conclusion summarizes limitations and advantages of the two prongs underlying Dryad's metadata effort.",

Design/methodology/approach: This case study employs simple statistical analyses to a set of harvested metadata. Findings: This paper documents the use of unqualified Dublin Core (uDC) elements in the metadata harvested from the repositories participating in the CARL harvester, and identifies patterns in the use of that metadata. It also compares these findings with a similar study, and identifies areas for further research. Research limitations/implications: This paper is limited to discussion of the characteristics of a relatively small set of metadata collected using the Open Archives Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting. However, analyses reveal some patterns in the use of this metadata that are valuable in the development of best practices for repository implementers. Practical implications: This paper documents the use of uDC elements by a specific community. Its findings will form a basis for developing mechanisms for improving the effectiveness of the metadata generated by that community and therefore the services built around that metadata. Originality/value: While there are several other studies that take an approach similar to that taken in this paper, no one has yet studied this specific data set. More generally, this paper contributes a valuable case study to research on the implementation of the Open Archives Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting. (Author abstract)",

	abstract = "Websites that provide content creation and sharing features have become quite popular recently. These sites allow users to categorize and browse content using tags' or free-text keyword topics. Since users contribute and tag social media content across a variety of social web platforms, creating new knowledge from distributed tag data has become a matter of performing various tasks, including publishing, aggregating, integrating, and republishing tag data. However, there are a number of issues in relation to data sharing and interoperability when processing tag data across heterogeneous tagging platforms. In this paper we introduce a semantic tag model that aims to explicitly offer the necessary structure, semantics and relationships between tags. This approach provides an improved opportunity for representing tag data in the form of reusable constructs at a semantic level. We also demonstrate a prototype that consumes and makes use of shared tag metadata across heterogeneous sources. 10.1177/0165551509346785",

Metadata play a key role in these tasks as they offer the basis upon which more advanced services can be built. However, it is not always the case that such collections' metadata expose explicit or even well-structured semantics. Ways to bridge this "semantic gap" are increasingly being sought, as our review of the current state-of-the-art reveals. Most importantly though, in this paper we comment on two well-known metadata standards, popular in cultural heritage applications, namely {CIDOC-CRM} and Dublin Core; as diverse their scope may be, we nevertheless show how applications can benefit from a transition to explicit semantic structures in these domains, in a way as painless as possible and conformant to Semantic Web standards. We conclude by presenting a concrete, prototype implementation that serves as a proof-of-concept about the ideas argued for.},

Ontology development for a specific knowledge domain is however a difficult task, because the produced representation has to be adequately detailed and broad enough at the same time. The CIDOC-CRM is such an ontology, pertaining to cultural heritage, which we align to the Semantic Web environment: first transforming it to OWL and then profiling it not in the usual flat metadata sense, but by refining and extending its conceptual structures, taking advantage of OWL semantics. This kind of profiling maintains applicability of the model, while enabling more expressive reasoning tasks. To this end, we construct a mechanism for acquiring implied and web-distributed information that is used to conduct and present a series of experimental inferences on the CRM profiled form.",

Five aspects of interindexer consistency were analysed. Two methods were used to calculate interindexer consistency: one posited by Hooper (1965) and the other by Rollin (1981). Aspects analysed were: checktag consistency (66.24\% using Hooper's calculation and 77.17\% using Rollin's); major-to-all term consistency (49.31\% and 62.59\% respectively); overall indexing consistency (49.02\% and 63.32\%); classification code consistency (44.17\% and 45.00\%); and major-to-major term consistency (43.24\% and 56.09\%). The average consistency across all categories was 50.4\% using Hooper's method and 60.83\% using Rollin's. Although comparison with previous studies is difficult due to methodological variations in the overall study of indexing consistency and the specific characteristics of the database, results generally support previous findings when trends and similar studies are analysed. 10.1177/096100060003200102",

This study considers a more advanced problem, namely how to discover knowledge not contained in a single source from combined historical facts. By using a well-designed core ontology in the cultural domain (CIDOC CRM, ISO21127), this study discusses the requirement for a robust inference platform for real-life knowledge discovery and integration over distributed sources. The methodology and design are justified in detail through functional requirements for an inference service with the capability of inferring new knowledge from combinations of facts distributed over different sources. A number of critical issues for developing such a robust inference platform are identified, namely (1) systematic accumulation of common concepts and inference rules; (2) extending the ontology with metaclasses; (3) accumulation of factual and categorical knowledge; (4) incorporation of fuzzy inference into the inference engine, and (5) improvement of performance and scalability in the inference engine.",

	abstract = "Current data integration approaches by bioinformaticians frequently involve extracting data from a wide variety of public and private data repositories, each with a unique vocabulary and schema, via scripts. These separate data sets must then be normalized through the tedious and lengthy process of resolving naming differences and collecting information into a single view. Attempts to consolidate such diverse data using data warehouses or federated queries add significant complexity and have shown limitations in flexibility. The alternative of complete semantic integration of data requires a massive, sustained effort in mapping data types and maintaining ontologies. We focused instead on creating a data architecture that leverages semantic mapping of experimental metadata, to support the rapid prototyping of scientific discovery applications with the twin goals of reducing architectural complexity while still leveraging semantic technologies to provide flexibility, efficiency and more fully characterized data relationships. A metadata ontology was developed to describe our discovery process. A metadata repository was then created by mapping metadata from existing data sources into this ontology, generating RDF triples to describe the entities. Finally an interface to the repository was designed which provided not only search and browse capabilities but complex query templates that aggregate data from both RDF and RDBMS sources. We describe how this approach (i) allows scientists to discover and link relevant data across diverse data sources and (ii) provides a platform for development of integrative informatics applications. 10.1093/bib/bbp007",

@MastersThesis{ citeulike:2295482,
	abstract = "A primary motivation for the development of the Semantic Web has been the need for effective information retrieval systems which may be realised through vocabulary control and the use of structured metadata. The technological framework of the Web (URI, HTTP, XML) and of the Semantic Web (RDF, OWL, SPARQL) provides a platform upon which distributed data and metadata applications may be constructed, but does not in itself provide any direct support for information retrieval applications per se. Widely applicable Semantic Web languages that extend this basic layer and provide generic support for retrieval applications, in addition to good practice guidelines and design patterns for developing such applications, are required.The ultimate purpose of this report is to develop a formal theory of retrieval using controlled vocabularies that have a simple and intuitive structure, to provide the necessary theoretical foundations for the development of Semantic Web languages and design patterns for distributed retrieval applications. The main body of this report is devoted to the articulation of such a theory. The theory is expressed formally through the use of mathematical notation, with the intention that this level of formality will provide the bridge between informal requirements specifications and the implementation of effective retrieval applications in computer systems.Specifically, a theory is developed to describe the ways in which a structured vocabulary may be used to construct an index over a collection of objects and then used to express queries which may be evaluated against an index to obtain a set of results. This theory is extended to consider ways in which both the precision and recall of retrieval strategies may be improved, through the use of expansion and ranking techniques and through ” coordination”. The problem of translating between controlled vocabularies is also considered. The theory attempts to formalise, unify and extend the traditional wisdom of the library sciences regarding the use of thesauri, classification schemes, subject heading systems, taxonomies and other types of structured vocabulary, so that proven techniques and methodologies may be transferred to a Semantic Web context.The recently chartered W3C Semantic Web Deployment Working Group has been charged with the development of the Simple Knowledge Organisation System (SKOS) to W3C Recommendation status. SKOS is a Semantic Web language specifically intended to support information retrieval applications using controlled vocabularies that have a relatively simple structure. A formal requirements specification is the first planned deliverable in the standardisation of SKOS. An immediate goal of this report is to provide a level of abstraction that can be used to perform a comparative analysis of use cases involving information retrieval systems that operate with structured vocabularies, so that the requirements of these systems with respect to Semantic Web languages such as SKOS may be clearly determined. Also, this report suggests ways in which the theory may be mapped to concrete language constructs and representation patterns in Semantic Web languages. In so doing it is hoped that the development of SKOS and similar languages may be grounded with sufficient rigour to ensure their wide applicability and consistent use.",

These complexities and dynamics make system maintenance a non-trivial task, since it requires periodical evaluation of the different DL components. Generally, these evaluations are customized per system and are performed only when problems occur and administrator intervention is required. This work aims to change the situation. We present 5SQual, a tool which provides ways to perform automatic and configurable evaluations of some of the most important DL components, among them, digital objects, metadata, and services. The tool implements diverse numeric indicators that are associated with eight quality dimensions described in the 5S quality model. Its generic architecture was developed to be applicable to various DLs and scenarios. In sum, the main contributions of this work include: (i) the design and implementation of 5SQual, a tool that validates a theoretical DL quality model; (ii) the demonstration of the applicability of the tool in several usage scenarios; and (iii) the evaluation (with usability specialists) of its graphical interface specially designed to guide the configuration of 5SQual evaluations.

	abstract = "This study evaluates the data sources and research methods used in earlier studies to rank the research productivity of Library and Information Science (LIS) faculty and schools. In doing so, the study identifies both tools and methods that generate more accurate publication count rankings as well as databases that should be taken into consideration when conducting comprehensive searches in the literature for research and curricular needs. With a list of 2,625 items published between 1982 and 2002 by 68 faculty members of 18 American Library Association- (ALA-) accredited LIS schools, hundreds of databases were searched. Results show that there are only 10 databases that provide significant coverage of the LIS indexed literature. Results also show that restricting the data sources to one, two, or even three databases leads to inaccurate rankings and erroneous conclusions. Because no database provides comprehensive coverage of the LIS literature, researchers must rely on a wide range of disciplinary and multidisciplinary databases for ranking and other research purposes. The study answers such questions as the following: Is the Association of Library and Information Science Education's (ALISE's) directory of members a reliable tool to identify a complete list of faculty members at LIS schools? How many and which databases are needed in a multifile search to arrive at accurate publication count rankings? What coverage will be achieved using a certain number of databases? Which research areas are well covered by which databases? What alternative methods and tools are available to supplement gaps among databases? Did coverage performance of databases change over time? What counting method should be used when determining what and how many items each LIS faculty and school has published? The authors recommend advanced analysis of research productivity to provide a more detailed assessment of research productivity of authors and programs.",

The paper concludes that the two-step procedure to indexing is insufficient to explain the indexing process and suggests that the domain-centered approach offers a guide for indexers that can help them manage the complexity of indexing.",

In this paper we compare and contrast metadata analysis tools that were developed simultaneously, but independently, at two New Zealand institutions during a period of national investment in research repositories: the Metadata Analysis Tool (MAT) at The University of Waikato, and the Kiwi Research Information Service (KRIS) at the National Library of New Zealand. The tools have many similarities: they are convenient, online, on-demand services that harvest metadata using OAI-PMH, they were developed in response to feedback from repository administrators, and they both help pinpoint specific metadata errors as well as generating summary statistics. They also have significant differences: one is a dedicated tool while the other is part of a wider access tool; one gives a holistic view of the metadata while the other looks for specific problems; one seeks patterns in the data values while the other checks that those values conform to metadata standards. Both tools work in a complementary manner to existing web-based administration tools. We have observed that discovery and correction of metadata errors can be quickly achieved by switching web browser views from the analysis tool to the repository interface, and back. We summarise the findings from both tools' deployment into a checklist of requirements for metadata analysis tools.",

	abstract = "Abstract Owing to the recent developments in automatic metadata generation and interoperability between digital repositories, the production of metadata is now vastly surpassing manual quality control capabilities. Abandoning quality control altogether is problematic, because low-quality metadata compromise the effectiveness of services that repositories provide to their users. To address this problem, we present a set of scalable quality metrics for metadata based on the Bruce \& Hillman framework for metadata quality control. We perform three experiments to evaluate our metrics: (1) the degree of correlation between the metrics and manual quality reviews, (2) the discriminatory power between metadata sets and (3) the usefulness of the metrics as low-quality filters. Through statistical analysis, we found that several metrics, especially Text Information Content, correlate well with human evaluation and that the average of all the metrics are roughly as effective as people to flag low-quality instances. The implications of this finding are discussed. Finally, we propose possible applications of the metrics to improve tools for the administration of digital repositories.",

	abstract = "In current library practice, trained human experts usually carry out document cataloguing and indexing based on a manual approach. With the explosive growth in the number of electronic documents available on the Internet and digital libraries, it is increasingly difficult for library practitioners to categorize both electronic documents and traditional library materials using just a manual approach. To improve the effectiveness and efficiency of document categorization at the library setting, more in-depth studies of using automatic document classification methods to categorize library items are required. Machine learning research has advanced rapidly in recent years. However, applying machine learning techniques to improve library practice is still a relatively unexplored area. This paper illustrates the design and development of a machine learning based automatic document classification system to alleviate the manual categorization problem encountered within the library setting. Two supervised machine learning algorithms have been tested. Our empirical tests show that supervised machine learning algorithms in general, and the k-nearest neighbours (KNN) algorithm in particular, can be used to develop an effective document classification system to enhance current library practice. Moreover, some concrete recommendations regarding how to practically apply the KNN algorithm to develop automatic document classification in a library setting are made. To our best knowledge, this is the first in-depth study of applying the KNN algorithm to automatic document classification based on the widely used LCC classification scheme adopted by many large libraries. 10.1177/0165551507082592",

The study ascertains the extent of difficulty in applying the DC metadata elements encountered by these professionals and examines factors engendering such difficulties during the metadata application process. Comments drawn from the survey participants (n = 141) show that conceptual ambiguities (41\%) and semantic overlaps (45\%) of the surveyed DC metadata elements are the most frequently cited factors causing difficulty and confusion, in turn leading to variant interpretations of DC metadata elements. This has the potential to bring forth inconsistent and inaccurate applications and implementation of the DC standard across institutions which can directly affect semantic interoperability across digital repositories. The high degree of difficulty (55.3\%) engendered by the Relation field indicates that further examination of this element is needed. 10.1177/0165551509337871",

We show that latent semantic analysis, augmented with a Part-of-Speech Tagger, may be an effective algorithm for classifying a textual document as well. Using Brille's Part-of-Speech Tagger, we truncate the singular value decomposition used in latent semantic analysis to reduce the size of the word-frequency matrix. This method is then tested on a toy problem, and has shown to increase search accuracy. We then relate these results to natural language processing and show that latent semantic analysis can be combined with context free grammars to infer semantic meaning from natural language. English is the natural language currently being used.",

Many of the existing mechanisms for the automated creation of metadata rely primarily on content analysis which can be costly and inefficient. The automatic metadata generation system proposed in this article leverages resource relationships generated from existing metadata as a medium for propagation from metadata-rich to metadata-poor resources. Because of its independence from content analysis, it can be applied to a wide variety of resource media types and is shown to be computationally inexpensive. The proposed method operates through two distinct phases. Occurrence and co-occurrence algorithms first generate an associative network of repository resources leveraging existing repository metadata. Second, using the associative network as a substrate, metadata associated with metadata-rich resources is propagated to metadata-poor resources by means of a discrete-form spreading activation algorithm. This article discusses the general framework for building associative networks, an algorithm for disseminating metadata through such networks, and the results of an experiment and validation of the proposed method using a standard bibliographic dataset.",

These constructs are grounded in empirical data from the perspectives of the three main sources in the communication process: health information providers, consumers, and intermediaries, such as Web directory creators and librarians, who assist consumers in finding healthcare information. The article also defines five constructs of Web page structural markers that could be used in information quality evaluation and maps these markers to the quality criteria. Findings from correlation analysis and multinomial logistic tests indicate that use of the structural markers depended significantly on the type of Web page and type of information provider. The findings suggest the need to define genre-specific templates for quality evaluation and the need to develop models for an automatic genre-based classification of health information Web pages. In addition, the study showed that consumers may lack the motivation or literacy skills to evaluate the information quality of health Web pages, which suggests the need to develop accessible automatic information quality evaluation tools and ontologies.",

However, the semantic Web's development so far has focused primarily on metadata and carefully designed data structures. To realize Berners-Lee's vision, the semantic Web must capture and represent content created every day by people without special training - such content includes blogs, emails, and discussion groups. Rhizome is an experimental, open source content management framework the author have created that can capture and represent informal, human-authored content in a semantically rich manner. Rhizome aims to help bring about a new kind of commons - one of ideas. This commons wouldn't comprise just a web of interlinked pages of content, as is the current World Wide Web, but a web of relationships between the underlying ideas and distinctions that the content implies: a permanent, universally accessible interlinking of content based on imputed semantics such as concepts, definitions, or structured argumentation.},

However, it is not yet clear what knowledge architectures are most appropriate for creating a digital museum in order to facilitate an effective collection, organization, conservation, and experience of cultural and artistic heritage. In this paper, we discuss the concept of ” fluid ontologies,” a novel, dynamic structure for organizing and browsing knowledge in a digital museum. Fluid ontologies are flexible knowledge structures that evolve and adapt to communities' interest based on contextual information articulated by human contributors, curators, and viewers, as well as artificial bots that are able to track interaction histories and infer relationships among knowledge pieces and preferences of viewers. Fluid ontologies allow for a tighter coupling between communities' interests and the browsing structure of a digital museum. We present the key ideas behind the use of fluid ontologies within the context of digital museum design and seminal work in metadata/dynamic ontologies, particularly as it pertains to objects of cultural heritage, and discuss these characteristics in three concrete examples: (1) Village Voice, an online agora that ties together the narratives created by a group of Somali refugees using an iteration of community-designed ontologies, (2) Eventspace, a node-based collaborative archive for design activities, and (3) Tribal Peace, an online digital museum still under construction and evaluation that uses proactive agents to tie distributed Kumeyaay, Luiseno, and Cupeno reservations together in their quest to achieve greater political sovereignty .",

Along with some discussion of why and how metadata quality is important, an approach to conceptualizing, measuring, and assessing metadata quality is presented. The approach given in this paper is based on a more general model of information quality (IQ) for many kinds of information beyond just metadata. A key feature of the general model is its ability to condition quality assessments by context of information use, such as the types of activities that use the information, and the typified norms and values of relevant information-using communities. The paper presents a number of statistical characterizations of analyzed samples of metadata from a large corpus built as part of the Institute of Museum and Library Services Digital Collections and Contents (IMLS DCC) project containing OAI-harvested metadata and links these statistical assessments to the quality measures, and interprets them. Finally the paper discusses several approaches to quality improvement for metadata based on the study findings.",

The development of efficient machine learning methods in order to facilitate the organization of these databases and the extraction of novel biomedical knowledge is becoming increasingly important. Several of these methods require the representation of the documents as vectors of variables forming large multivariate datasets. Since the amount of information contained in different datasets is voluminous, an open issue is to combine information gained from various sources to a concise new dataset, which will efficiently represent the corpus of documents. This paper investigates the use of the multivariate statistical approach, called Non-Linear Canonical Correlation Analysis (NLCCA), for exploiting the correlation among the variables of different document representations and describing the documents with only one new dataset. Experiments with document datasets represented by text words, Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) and Gene Ontology (GO) terms showed the effectiveness of NLCCA.",

	abstract = "In image retrieval, most systems lack user-centred evaluation since they are assessed by some chosen ground truth dataset. The results reported through precision and recall assessed against the ground truth are thought of as being an acceptable surrogate for the judgment of real users. Much current research focuses on automatically assigning keywords to images for enhancing retrieval effectiveness. However, evaluation methods are usually based on system-level assessment, e.g. classification accuracy based on some chosen ground truth dataset. In this paper, we present a qualitative evaluation methodology for automatic image indexing systems. The automatic indexing task is formulated as one of image annotation, or automatic metadata generation for images. The evaluation is composed of two individual methods. First, the automatic indexing annotation results are assessed by human subjects. Second, the subjects are asked to annotate some chosen images as the test set whose annotations are used as ground truth. Then, the system is tested by the test set whose annotation results are judged against the ground truth. Only one of these methods is reported for most systems on which user-centred evaluation are conducted. We believe that both methods need to be considered for full evaluation. We also provide an example evaluation of our system based on this methodology. According to this study, our proposed evaluation methodology is able to provide deeper understanding of the system's performance.",

Indeed, the lack of temporal capabilities in themost common Web protocol, HTTP, prevents getting to an archived resource on thebasis of the URI of its original. This turns accessing archived resources intoa significant discovery challenge for both human and software agents, whichtypically involves following a multitude of links from the original to thearchival resource, or of searching archives for the original URI. This paperproposes the protocol-based Memento solution to address this problem, anddescribes a proof-of-concept experiment that includes major servers of archivalcontent, including Wikipedia and the Internet Archive.

Restriction to valid XML data also gives X-Map some advantage, including well-formedness, parsing, and data element identification. Essentially, X-Map uses the definition of equivalence to plant seeds of possible correlation between schema elements, speculates on the relation\&\#039;s correctness, then continuously re-evaluates the correctness of the speculative relations when given additional information from newly introduced schemas. In e\#ect, X-Map generates and harbors a large growing body of knowledge between the elements of the many schemas that it encounters.

The author describes an automated process of adding new terms to thesauri as entry vocabulary by analyzing the association between words/phrases extracted from bibliographic titles and subject descriptors in the metadata record (subject descriptors are terms assigned from controlled vocabularies of thesauri to describe the subjects of the objects [e.g., books, articles] represented by the metadata records). The investigated approach uses a corpus of metadata for scientific and technical (S\&T) publications in which the titles contain substantive words for key topics. The three steps of the method are (a) extracting words and phrases from the title field of the metadata; (b) applying a method to identify and select the specific and meaningful keywords based on the associated controlled vocabulary terms from the thesaurus used to catalog the objects; and (c) inserting selected keywords into the thesaurus as new terms (most of them are in hierarchical relationships with the existing concepts), thereby updating the thesaurus with new terminology that is being used in the literature. The effectiveness of the method was demonstrated by an experiment with the Chinese Classification Thesaurus (CCT) and bibliographic data in China Machine-Readable Cataloging Record (MARC) format (CNMARC) provided by Peking University Library. This approach is equally effective in large-scale collections and in other languages.",

They can be used in many applications related to knowledge management and text mining, such as automatic text summarization, development of search engines, document clustering, document classification, thesaurus construction, and browsing interfaces. Because only a small portion of documents have keyphrases assigned by authors, and it is time-consuming and costly to manually assign keyphrases to documents, it is necessary to develop an algorithm to automatically generate keyphrases for documents. This paper describes a Keyphrase Identification Program (KIP), which extracts document keyphrases by using prior positive samples of human identified phrases to assign weights to the candidate keyphrases. The logic of our algorithm is: The more keywords a candidate keyphrase contains and the more significant these keywords are, the more likely this candidate phrase is a keyphrase. KIP's learning function can enrich the glossary database by automatically adding new identified keyphrases to the database. KIP's personalization feature will let the user build a glossary database specifically suitable for the area of his/her interest. The evaluation results show that KIP's performance is better than the systems we compared to and that the learning function is effective.",

	abstract = "Large amounts of data in modern information systems, such as the World Wide Web, require innovative information retrieval techniques to effectively satisfy users' information need. A promising approach is to exploit document semantics in the IR process. For this purpose, high-quality semantic metadata is needed. This paper introduces a method to automatically create semantic metadata by using ontologically enhanced versions of common information extraction methods, such as named entity recognition and coreference resolution. Furthermore, this work also proposes the application of ontology-specific heuristic rules to further improve the quality of generated metadata. The results of our method was evaluated using a small test collection.",

One thousand three hundred six member-contributed Chinese records were randomly selected from the OCLC database and were examined by the researcher. Commonly occurring errors were identified and were categorized into three classes: format errors, content deficiency and inconsistency errors, and typographical errors of editing and inputting. The relationship between the number of times a record had been enhanced and errors still occurring in it was also studied.",
