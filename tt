    "abstract": "Web documents are available in various forms, most of which do not carry additional semantics. This paper presents a model for general document metadata extraction. The model, which combines segmentation by keywords and pattern matching techniques, was implemented using PHP, MySQL, JavaScript and HTML. The system was tested with 40 randomly selected PDF documents (mainly theses). An evaluation of the system was done using standard criteria measures namely precision, recall, accuracy and F-measure. The results show that the model is relatively effective for the task of metadata extraction, especially for theses and dissertations. A combination of machine learning with these rule-based methods will be explored in the future for better results. 10.1177/0165551509105195",

    "abstract": "The development of the Semantic Web, with machine-readable content, has the potential to revolutionize the World Wide Web and its use. <i>A Semantic Web Primer</i> provides an introduction and guide to this emerging field, describing its key ideas, languages, and technologies. Suitable for use as a textbook or for self-study by professionals, it concentrates on undergraduate-level fundamental concepts and techniques that will enable readers to proceed with building applications on their own. It includes exercises, project descriptions, and annotated references to relevant online materials. A Semantic Web Primer is the only available book on the Semantic Web to include a systematic treatment of the different languages (XML, RDF, OWL, and rules) and technologies (explicit metadata, ontologies, and logic and inference) that are central to Semantic Web development. The book also examines such crucial related topics as ontology engineering and application scenarios.<br /> <br /> After an introductory chapter, topics covered in succeeding chapters include XML and related technologies that support semantic interoperability; RDF and RDF Schema, the standard data model for machine-processable semantics; and OWL, the W3C-approved standard for a Web ontology language more extensive than RDF Schema; rules, both monotonic and nonmonotonic, in the framework of the Semantic Web; selected application domains and how the Semantic Web would benefit them; the development of ontology-based systems; and current debates on key issues and predictions for the future.",

Much research has been done in the field of digital libraries, but in the case of historical archives, which have particular needs, this is not the case. To this end, we investigate the use of new tools, which are based on the ontology of the historical archive in order to provide a new and effective method for document retrieval in a dynamic environment which will take into account the collaboration needs of the users.",

    "abstract": "The mathematical concept of document resemblance captures well the informal notion of syntactic similarity. The resemblance can be estimated using a fixed size \u201d sketch\u201d for each document. For a large collection of documents (say hundreds of millions) the size of this sketch is of the order of a few hundred bytes per document. However, for efficient large scale web indexing it is not necessary to determine the actual resemblance value: it suffices to determine whether newly encountered documents are duplicates or near-duplicates of documents already indexed. In other words, it suffices to determine whether the resemblance is above a certain threshold. In this talk we show how this determination can be made using a \u201d sample\u201d of less than 50 bytes per document. The basic approach for computing resemblance has two aspects: first, resemblance is expressed as a set (of strings) intersection problem, and second, the relative size of intersections is evaluated by a process of random sampling that can be done independently for each document. The process of estimating the relative size of intersection of sets and the threshold test discussed above can be applied to arbitrary sets, and thus might be of independent interest. The algorithm for filtering near-duplicate documents discussed here has been successfully implemented and has been used for the last three years in the context of the AltaVista search engine.",

Instead of trying to understand or build brains from the bottom up, its goal is to understand and build intelligent behavior from the top down, putting the focus on what an agent needs to know in order to behave intelligently, how this knowledge can be represented symbolically, and how automated reasoning procedures can make this knowledge available as needed. <br><br>This landmark text takes the central concepts of knowledge representation developed over the last 50 years and illustrates them in a lucid and compelling way. Each of the various styles of representation is presented in a simple and intuitive form, and the basics of reasoning with that representation are explained in detail. This approach gives readers a solid foundation for understanding the more advanced work found in the research literature. The presentation is clear enough to be accessible to a broad audience, including researchers and practitioners in database management, information retrieval, and object-oriented systems as well as artificial intelligence.

    "abstract": "The quality of the metadata records in a digital library has a critical effect on its information access and retrieval. The open source Metadata Repository at the National Science Digital Library {(NSDL)} comprises of collections of metadata submitted from various data providers and is open for harvesting by the public. Since metadata in the repository came from many different data providers, there is a lack of consistency. This lack of consistent hampers the information services provided by the {NSDL} to its own web users as well as to aggregators who harvest the {NSDL} data. The goal of this study is to assess the quality of the current metadata records in the {NSDL} Repository. We harvested over one million Dublin Core metadata records submitted through November 2005 to the repository using the Open Archives Initiative Protocol {(OAIP).} The data harvested was loaded into an Excel database and exhaustive tabulations of all the Dublin Core metadata fields were performed. The criteria of quality assessment are based on the following areas: consistency, completeness, accuracy and local additions of data providers. This study reports on the results of the tabulations and assessment of metadata quality. Information organizations and institutions will benefit from the results of this study in determining which parts of the repository they aim to harvest. The data collected for this study will be made available to the public to contribute to promoting studies on metadata quality improvement by enabling other researchers to have access to the data for further analysis.",

    "abstract": "With the proliferation of Web 2.0 technologies, there is an expanded opportunity for individuals to get involved in information exchange. In this study, the sustainability of a virtual community for teachers and educators were investigated. The research model borrows the key concepts from the IS continuance model, social influence theory, the uses and gratifications paradigm, and relationship marketing to explain user intention to continue using a virtual community, as well as intention to recommend the community to others. Satisfaction, commitment, group norms are found to have significant impacts on intention to continue using and intention to recommend. Among the three factors, satisfaction has the highest impact on behavioral intentions. Individual-related factors (purposive value and self-discovery) are found to have significant impacts on user satisfaction, while social-related factors are more important in determining commitment and group norms. The results of this study provide important implications for both research and practice. 10.1177/0165551508099088",

    "abstract": "Recent proposals to improve the quality of interaction with the World Wide Web suggest considering the Web as a huge semi-structured database, so that retrieving information can be supported by the task of database querying. Under this view, it is important to represent the form of both the network, and the documents placed in the nodes of the network. However, the current proposals do not pay sufficient attention to represent document structures and reasoning about them. In this paper, we address these problems by providing a framework where Document Type Definitions (DTDs) expressed in the eXtensible Markup Language (XML) are formalized in an expressive Description Logic equipped with sound and complete inference algorithms. We provide methods for verifying conformance of a document to a DTD in polynomial time, and structural equivalence of DTDs in worst case deterministic exponential time, improving known algorithms for this problem which were double exponential. We also deal with pa...",

    "abstract": "It is often assumed that the amount of interindexer consistency experienced under a given method of indexing is somehow indicative of the quality of the indexing. To explore this assumption, two hypotheses are stated concerning the possible connection between interindexer consistency and indexing quality. A specific counter-example is then exhibited which shows both hypotheses to be invalid. Although a mathematical analysis of the counterexample yields certain insights, the general relationship between interindexer consistency and successful retrieval is more subtle than might have been expected. It is concluded that until equations describing this relationship have been derived, measurements of interindexer consistency will have little meaning as clues to indexing quality.",

    "abstract": "Metadata enables users to find the resources they require, therefore it is an important component of any digital learning object repository. Much work has already been done within the learning technology community to assure metadata quality, focused on the development of metadata standards, specifications and vocabularies and their implementation within repositories. The metadata creation process has thus far been largely overlooked. There has been an assumption that metadata creation will be straightforward and that where machines cannot generate metadata effectively, authors of learning materials will be the most appropriate metadata creators. However, repositories are reporting difficulties in obtaining good quality metadata from their contributors, and it is becoming apparent that the issue of metadata creation warrants attention. This paper surveys the growing body of evidence, including three UK-based case studies, scopes the issues surrounding human-generated metadata creation and identifies questions for further investigation. Collaborative creation of metadata by resource authors and metadata specialists, and the design of tools and processes, are emerging as key areas for deeper research. Research is also needed into how end users will search learning object repositories.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Long-term digital preservation, the process of maintaining digital objects through time to ensure continued access, has become a crucial issue in recent years. Whilst the amount of digitised information is constantly increasing, so too is the pace of progress in information technology, resulting in obsolescence of the software and hardware required to access and view digital information. Despite many organisations recognising this threat and the resulting need for preservation action, more work is required to effectively address the issue. We present in this article a framework for the long-term digital preservation of 3-D data. This framework is based on two pertinent preservation practices, emulation and metadata which ensure that the authenticity and usability, respectively, of a preserved digital object remain intact through time. An evaluation of our framework is presented which illustrates the viability of our approach in retaining accessibility, authenticity and usability for future end users.",

The CIDOC CRM is now in the process to become an International Organization for Standardization (ISO) standard. This article justifies in detail the methodology and design by functional requirements and gives examples of its contents. The CIDOC CRM analyzes the common conceptualizations behind data and metadata structures to support data transformation, mediation, and merging. It is argued that such ontologies are property-centric, in contrast to terminological systems, and should be built with different methodologies. It is demonstrated that ontological and epistemological arguments are equally important for an effective design, in particular when dealing with knowledge from the past in any domain. It is assumed that the presented methodology and the upper level of the ontology are applicable in a far wider domain.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we argue that a core ontology is one of the key building blocks necessary to enable the scalable assimilation of information from diverse sources. A complete and extensible ontology that expresses the basic concepts that are common across a variety of domains and can provide the basis for specialization into domain-specific concepts and vocabularies, is essential for well-defined mappings between domain-specific knowledge representations (i.e., metadata vocabularies) and the subsequent building of a variety of services such as cross-domain searching, browsing, data mining and knowledge extraction. This paper describes the results of a series of three workshops held in 2001 and 2002 which brought together representatives from the cultural heritage and digital library communities with the goal of harmonizing their knowledge perspectives and producing a core ontology. The knowledge perspectives of these two communities were represented by the CIDOC/CRM [31], an ontology for information exchange in the cultural heritage and museum community, and the ABC ontology [33], a model for the exchange and integration of digital library information. This paper describes the mediation process between these two different knowledge biases and the results of this mediation -- the harmonization of the ABC and CIDOC/CRM ontologies, which we believe may provide a useful basis for information integration in the wider scope of the involved communities.",

    "abstract": "The digital age has caused the paradigm to shift in academic libraries both in terms of their collections and the roles of their personnel. As academic libraries begin to digitize objects in their collections, how and who in the library creates access to these resources has become a hot issue. At the University of Nebraska-Lincoln Libraries (UNL Libraries), taskforces were formed to study metadata schemes used at UNL Libraries. The taskforces identified the various metadata schemes in use and the role of various departments within UNL Libraries in the creation of metadata. They made recommendations about how to document decisions relating to metadata and how to coordinate metadata creation and digitization projects. As a result, the authors decided to survey American Research Libraries (ARL) and other peer libraries to determine their metadata workflow. This paper discusses the results of the survey and provides insight as to how libraries may meet the challenge of creating metadata through the reorganization of departments and staffing responsibilities.",

    "abstract": "As the World Wide Web continues to expand, it becomes increasingly difficult for users to obtain information efficiently. Because most search engines read format languages such as HTML or SGML, search results reflect formatting tags more than actual page content, which is expressed in natural language. <i>Spinning the Semantic Web</i> describes an exciting new type of hierarchy and standardization that will replace the current \"web of links\" with a \"web of meaning.\" Using a flexible set of languages and tools, the Semantic Web will make all available information -- display elements, metadata, services, images, and especially content -- accessible. The result will be an immense repository of information accessible for a wide range of new applications.<br /> <br /> This first handbook for the Semantic Web covers, among other topics, software agents that can negotiate and collect information, markup languages that can tag many more types of information in a document, and knowledge systems that enable machines to read Web pages and determine their reliability. The truly interdisciplinary Semantic Web combines aspects of artificial intelligence, markup languages, natural language processing, information retrieval, knowledge representation, intelligent agents, and databases.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\\&nbsp;\\&nbsp;Digital libraries (DLs) have eluded definitional consensus and lack agreement on common theories and frameworks. This makes comparison of DLs extremely difficult, promotes ad-hoc development, and impedes interoperability. In this paper we propose a formal ontology for DLs that defines the fundamental concepts, relationships, and axiomatic rules that govern the DL domain, therefore providing a frame of reference for the discussion of essential concepts of DL design and construction. The ontology is an axiomatic, formal treatment of DLs, which distinguishes it from other approaches that informally define a number of architectural variants. The process of construction of the ontology was guided by 5S, a formal framework for digital libraries. To test its expressibility we have used the ontology to create a taxonomy of DL services and to reason about issues of reusability, extensibility, and composability. Some practical applications of the ontology are also described including: the definition of a digital library services taxonomy, the proposal of a modeling language for digital libraries, and the specification of quality metrics to evaluate digital libraries. We also demonstrate how to use the ontology to formally describe DL architectures and to prove some properties about them, thus helping to further validate the ontology.",

    "abstract": "Ontologies provide a common vocabulary of an area and define, with different levels of formality, the meaning of the terms and the relationships between them. Ontological engineering refers to the set of activities concerning the ontology development process, the ontology life cycle, the methods and methodologies for building ontologies, and the tool suites and languages that support them. During the last decade, increasing attention has been focused on ontologies. Ontologies are now widely used in knowledge engineering, artificial intelligence and computer science; in applications related to areas such as knowledge management, natural language processing, e-commerce, intelligent information integration, bio-informatics, education; and in new emerging fields like the semantic web. The book presents the major issues of ontological engineering and describes the most outstanding ontologies currently available. It covers the practical aspects of selecting and applying methodologies, languages, and tools for building ontologies. Ontological Engineering will be of great value to students and researchers, and to developers who want to integrate ontologies in their information systems. ",

The top level Web page for each resource, from a sample of 29 resources obtained from National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS), was submitted to both generators. Results indicate that extraction processing algorithms can contribute to useful automatic metadata generation. Results also indicate that harvesting metadata from META tags created by humans can have a positive impact on automatic metadata generation. The study identifies several ways in which automatic metadata generation applications can be improved and highlights several important areas of research. The conclusion is that integrating extraction of harvesting methods will be the best approach to creating optimal metadata, and more research is needed to identify when to apply which method.",

Automatic metadata generation research is reviewed and the study's methods, key findings and conclusions are presented. Participants anticipate greater accuracy with automatic techniques for technical metadata (e.g., ID, language, and format metadata) compared to metadata requiring intellectual discretion (e.g., subject and description metadata). Support for implementing automatic techniques paralleled anticipated accuracy results. Metadata experts are in favour of using automatic techniques, although they are generally not in favour of eliminating human evaluation or production for the more intellectually demanding metadata. Results are incorporated into Version 1.0 of the Recommended Functionalities for automatic metadata generation applications (Appendix A).",

    "abstract": "In this article, we elaborate on the meaning of quality in digital libraries (DLs) by proposing a model that is deeply grounded in a formal framework for digital libraries: 5S (Streams, Structures, Spaces, Scenarios, and Societies). For each major DL concept in the framework we formally define a number of dimensions of quality and propose a set of numerical indicators for those quality dimensions. In particular, we consider key concepts of a minimal DL: catalog, collection, digital object, metadata specification, repository, and services. Regarding quality dimensions, we consider: accessibility, accuracy, completeness, composability, conformance, consistency, effectiveness, efficiency, extensibility, pertinence, preservability, relevance, reliability, reusability, significance, similarity, and timeliness. Regarding measurement, we consider characteristics like: response time (with regard to efficiency), cost of migration (with respect to preservability), and number of service failures (to assess reliability). For some key DL concepts, the (quality dimension, numerical indicator) pairs are illustrated through their application to a number of \u201d real-world\u201d digital libraries. We also discuss connections between the proposed dimensions of DL quality and an expanded version of a workshop's consensus view of the life cycle of information in digital libraries. Such connections can be used to determine when and where quality issues can be measured, assessed, and improved -- as well as how possible quality problems can be prevented, detected, and eliminated.",

    "abstract": "This article presents the semantic portal MuseumFinland for publishing heterogeneous museum collections on the Semantic Web. It is shown how museums with their semantically rich and interrelated collection content can create a large, consolidated semantic collection portal together on the web. By sharing a set of ontologies, it is possible to make collections semantically interoperable, and provide the museum visitors with intelligent content-based search and browsing services to the global collection base. The architecture underlying MuseumFinland separates generic search and browsing services from the underlying application dependent schemas and metadata by a layer of logical rules. As a result, the portal creation framework and software developed has been applied successfully to other domains as well. MuseumFinland got the Semantic Web Challence Award (second prize) in 2004.",

    "abstract": "Metadata can be used to precisely represent data semantics. It can also serve to improve data sharing and exchange. Because the various types of metadata are created in different ways, they can suffer from a problem of inconsistency. Recently, metadata gateway methods have been researched to solve this problem. However, the performance of the existing approaches based on metadata schemas is poor and their maintenance (adaptation of metadata changes) is time consuming. In this paper, a novel message conversion system is proposed, which functions by separating the heterogeneous mapping information from the mapping rules of the metadata, in order to overcome the drawbacks of the existing metadata gateway methods. The proposed system controls the standardized data elements dynamically based on the Metadata Registry (MDR), which is one of the most important elements of the ISO/IEC 11179 standard. The problems associated with adding supplementary metadata are resolved, since the standard provides for incorporating additional data elements created in the future. MSDL is defined as a protocol which can be used for exchanging messages between heterogeneous systems, and which ensures that all of the systems have their own independent metadata schemas. 10.1177/0165551505055403",

Design/methodology/approach -- {UW} E-thesis Project decisions on issues associated with electronic submission and {OA} are presented. Partnerships with Theses Canada and the Networked Digital Library of Theses and Dissertations are described and the goals and activities of these organizations are outlined. Findings -- Author-created metadata form the {UW} E-theses searchable database of records that link to theses in full text. The metadata are {OAI} compliant and are harvested by Theses Canada and the {ETD} Union Catalog. The E-theses Project supports authors' rights while minimizing access restrictions and encourages innovations while respecting the value of gradually evolving thesis standards and traditions. The success of the {UW} E-thesis Project illustrates that progress can be made toward the {OA} paradigm for theses and dissertations while upholding perennial values. Collaborations with like-minded organizations support and advance these goals. Originality/value -- Academic librarians and graduate studies officers will find this e-thesis project description and this discussion of issues relevant to planning and maintaining electronic thesis submission and access systems at their own universities.

    "abstract": "Purpose: To explain the background, functionality, and content of the CARL metadata harvester and search service, http: //carl-abrc-oai.lib.sfu.ca/, and to outline plans for improving the service. Design/methodology/approach: This case study employs simple statistical analyses to a set of harvested metadata. Findings: This paper documents the use of unqualified Dublin Core (uDC) elements in the metadata harvested from the repositories participating in the CARL harvester, and identifies patterns in the use of that metadata. It also compares these findings with a similar study, and identifies areas for further research. Research limitations/implications: This paper is limited to discussion of the characteristics of a relatively small set of metadata collected using the Open Archives Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting. However, analyses reveal some patterns in the use of this metadata that are valuable in the development of best practices for repository implementers. Practical implications: This paper documents the use of uDC elements by a specific community. Its findings will form a basis for developing mechanisms for improving the effectiveness of the metadata generated by that community and therefore the services built around that metadata. Originality/value: While there are several other studies that take an approach similar to that taken in this paper, no one has yet studied this specific data set. More generally, this paper contributes a valuable case study to research on the implementation of the Open Archives Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting. (Author abstract)",

    "abstract": "Websites that provide content creation and sharing features have become quite popular recently. These sites allow users to categorize and browse content using tags' or free-text keyword topics. Since users contribute and tag social media content across a variety of social web platforms, creating new knowledge from distributed tag data has become a matter of performing various tasks, including publishing, aggregating, integrating, and republishing tag data. However, there are a number of issues in relation to data sharing and interoperability when processing tag data across heterogeneous tagging platforms. In this paper we introduce a semantic tag model that aims to explicitly offer the necessary structure, semantics and relationships between tags. This approach provides an improved opportunity for representing tag data in the form of reusable constructs at a semantic level. We also demonstrate a prototype that consumes and makes use of shared tag metadata across heterogeneous sources. 10.1177/0165551509346785",

    "comment": "Digital collections often foster a large number of digital resources that need to be efficiently managed, described and disseminated. Metadata play a key role in these tasks as they offer the basis upon which more advanced services can be built. However, it is not always the case that such collections' metadata expose explicit or even well-structured semantics. Ways to bridge this \"semantic gap\" are increasingly being sought, as our review of the current state-of-the-art reveals. Most importantly though, in this paper we comment on two well-known metadata standards, popular in cultural heritage applications, namely {CIDOC-CRM} and Dublin Core; as diverse their scope may be, we nevertheless show how applications can benefit from a transition to explicit semantic structures in these domains, in a way as painless as possible and conformant to Semantic Web standards. We conclude by presenting a concrete, prototype implementation that serves as a proof-of-concept about the ideas argued for.",

    "abstract": "Ontologies on the Semantic Web form a basis for representing human-conceivable knowledge in a machine-understandable manner. Ontology development for a specific knowledge domain is however a difficult task, because the produced representation has to be adequately detailed and broad enough at the same time. The CIDOC-CRM is such an ontology, pertaining to cultural heritage, which we align to the Semantic Web environment: first transforming it to OWL and then profiling it not in the usual flat metadata sense, but by refining and extending its conceptual structures, taking advantage of OWL semantics. This kind of profiling maintains applicability of the model, while enabling more expressive reasoning tasks. To this end, we construct a mechanism for acquiring implied and web-distributed information that is used to conduct and present a series of experimental inferences on the CRM profiled form.",

    "abstract": "Reports results of a study to examine interindexer consistency (the degree to which indexers, when assigning terms to a chosen record, will choose the same terms to reflect that record) in the PsycINFO database using 60 records that were inadvertently processed twice between 1996 and 1998. Five aspects of interindexer consistency were analysed. Two methods were used to calculate interindexer consistency: one posited by Hooper (1965) and the other by Rollin (1981). Aspects analysed were: checktag consistency (66.24\\% using Hooper's calculation and 77.17\\% using Rollin's); major-to-all term consistency (49.31\\% and 62.59\\% respectively); overall indexing consistency (49.02\\% and 63.32\\%); classification code consistency (44.17\\% and 45.00\\%); and major-to-major term consistency (43.24\\% and 56.09\\%). The average consistency across all categories was 50.4\\% using Hooper's method and 60.83\\% using Rollin's. Although comparison with previous studies is difficult due to methodological variations in the overall study of indexing consistency and the specific characteristics of the database, results generally support previous findings when trends and similar studies are analysed. 10.1177/096100060003200102",

The research question is whether metadata elements and values can be automatically generated from the content of educational resources, and correctly assigned to mathematics and science educational materials. Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning techniques were implemented to automatically assign values of the GEMgenerate metadata element set tofor learning resources provided by the Gateway for Education (GEM), a service that offers web access to a wide range of educational materials. In a user study, education professionals evaluated the metadata assigned to learning resources by either automatic tagging or manual assignment. Results show minimal difference in the eyes of the evaluators between automatically generated metadata and manually assigned metadata.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\\&nbsp;\\&nbsp;Most information retrieval research focuses collecting documents that match the same set of concepts. This study considers a more advanced problem, namely how to discover knowledge not contained in a single source from combined historical facts. By using a well-designed core ontology in the cultural domain (CIDOC CRM, ISO21127), this study discusses the requirement for a robust inference platform for real-life knowledge discovery and integration over distributed sources. The methodology and design are justified in detail through functional requirements for an inference service with the capability of inferring new knowledge from combinations of facts distributed over different sources. A number of critical issues for developing such a robust inference platform are identified, namely (1) systematic accumulation of common concepts and inference rules; (2) extending the ontology with metaclasses; (3) accumulation of factual and categorical knowledge; (4) incorporation of fuzzy inference into the inference engine, and (5) improvement of performance and scalability in the inference engine.",

    "abstract": "Current data integration approaches by bioinformaticians frequently involve extracting data from a wide variety of public and private data repositories, each with a unique vocabulary and schema, via scripts. These separate data sets must then be normalized through the tedious and lengthy process of resolving naming differences and collecting information into a single view. Attempts to consolidate such diverse data using data warehouses or federated queries add significant complexity and have shown limitations in flexibility. The alternative of complete semantic integration of data requires a massive, sustained effort in mapping data types and maintaining ontologies. We focused instead on creating a data architecture that leverages semantic mapping of experimental metadata, to support the rapid prototyping of scientific discovery applications with the twin goals of reducing architectural complexity while still leveraging semantic technologies to provide flexibility, efficiency and more fully characterized data relationships. A metadata ontology was developed to describe our discovery process. A metadata repository was then created by mapping metadata from existing data sources into this ontology, generating RDF triples to describe the entities. Finally an interface to the repository was designed which provided not only search and browse capabilities but complex query templates that aggregate data from both RDF and RDBMS sources. We describe how this approach (i) allows scientists to discover and link relevant data across diverse data sources and (ii) provides a platform for development of integrative informatics applications. 10.1093/bib/bbp007",

    "abstract": "This study assesses the current metadata practices and trends in Association of Research Libraries (ARL) libraries, based on the survey Metadata conducted in spring 2007 (SPEC Kit 298: Metadata), a collaborative effort with the staff at the ARL. The survey investigates how metadata has been implemented in ARL member libraries: what kinds of projects or initiatives have been undertaken, what types of digital objects are associated with metadata, who are creating metadata, what schemas and tools are used to create and manage metadata, and the organizational changes and challenges resulting from the adoption of metadata in the libraries. The author summarizes her observations of the findings and the main themes that emerged from the metadata practices in libraries. She assesses the changing context of metadata creation and management and the evolution of metadata workflow and best practices in libraries. The author also discusses the roles and responsibilities of metadata professionals and the implications of metadata practices for the library and information community.",

    "abstract": "A primary motivation for the development of the Semantic Web has been the need for effective information retrieval systems which may be realised through vocabulary control and the use of structured metadata. The technological framework of the Web (URI, HTTP, XML) and of the Semantic Web (RDF, OWL, SPARQL) provides a platform upon which distributed data and metadata applications may be constructed, but does not in itself provide any direct support for information retrieval applications per se. Widely applicable Semantic Web languages that extend this basic layer and provide generic support for retrieval applications, in addition to good practice guidelines and design patterns for developing such applications, are required.The ultimate purpose of this report is to develop a formal theory of retrieval using controlled vocabularies that have a simple and intuitive structure, to provide the necessary theoretical foundations for the development of Semantic Web languages and design patterns for distributed retrieval applications. The main body of this report is devoted to the articulation of such a theory. The theory is expressed formally through the use of mathematical notation, with the intention that this level of formality will provide the bridge between informal requirements specifications and the implementation of effective retrieval applications in computer systems.Specifically, a theory is developed to describe the ways in which a structured vocabulary may be used to construct an index over a collection of objects and then used to express queries which may be evaluated against an index to obtain a set of results. This theory is extended to consider ways in which both the precision and recall of retrieval strategies may be improved, through the use of expansion and ranking techniques and through \u201d coordination\u201d. The problem of translating between controlled vocabularies is also considered. The theory attempts to formalise, unify and extend the traditional wisdom of the library sciences regarding the use of thesauri, classification schemes, subject heading systems, taxonomies and other types of structured vocabulary, so that proven techniques and methodologies may be transferred to a Semantic Web context.The recently chartered W3C Semantic Web Deployment Working Group has been charged with the development of the Simple Knowledge Organisation System (SKOS) to W3C Recommendation status. SKOS is a Semantic Web language specifically intended to support information retrieval applications using controlled vocabularies that have a relatively simple structure. A formal requirements specification is the first planned deliverable in the standardisation of SKOS. An immediate goal of this report is to provide a level of abstraction that can be used to perform a comparative analysis of use cases involving information retrieval systems that operate with structured vocabularies, so that the requirements of these systems with respect to Semantic Web languages such as SKOS may be clearly determined. Also, this report suggests ways in which the theory may be mapped to concrete language constructs and representation patterns in Semantic Web languages. In so doing it is hoped that the development of SKOS and similar languages may be grounded with sufficient rigour to ensure their wide applicability and consistent use.",

    "abstract": "Digital libraries (DLs) are complex information systems which can present changes in their structure, content, and services. These complexities and dynamics make system maintenance a non-trivial task, since it requires periodical evaluation of the different DL components. Generally, these evaluations are customized per system and are performed only when problems occur and administrator intervention is required. This work aims to change the situation. We present 5SQual, a tool which provides ways to perform automatic and configurable evaluations of some of the most important DL components, among them, digital objects, metadata, and services. The tool implements diverse numeric indicators that are associated with eight quality dimensions described in the 5S quality model. Its generic architecture was developed to be applicable to various DLs and scenarios. In sum, the main contributions of this work include: (i) the design and implementation of 5SQual, a tool that validates a theoretical DL quality model; (ii) the demonstration of the applicability of the tool in several usage scenarios; and (iii) the evaluation (with usability specialists) of its graphical interface specially designed to guide the configuration of 5SQual evaluations. We also present the results of interviews conducted with administrators of real DLs regarding their expectations and opinions about 5SQual.",

    "abstract": "This paper assesses the range of equivalence or mapping types required to facilitate interoperability in the context of a distributed terminology server. A detailed set of mapping types were examined, with a view to determining their validity for characterizing relationships between mappings from selected terminologies (AAT, LCSH, MeSH, and UNESCO) to the Dewey Decimal Classification (DDC) scheme. It was hypothesized that the detailed set of 19 match types proposed by Chaplan in 1995 is unnecessary in this context and that they could be reduced to a less detailed conceptually-based set. Results from an extensive mapping exercise support the main hypothesis and a generic suite of match types are proposed, although doubt remains over the current adequacy of the developing Simple Knowledge Organization System (SKOS) Core Mapping Vocabulary Specification (MVS) for inter-terminology mapping. 10.1177/0165551507079130",

    "abstract": "This study evaluates the data sources and research methods used in earlier studies to rank the research productivity of Library and Information Science (LIS) faculty and schools. In doing so, the study identifies both tools and methods that generate more accurate publication count rankings as well as databases that should be taken into consideration when conducting comprehensive searches in the literature for research and curricular needs. With a list of 2,625 items published between 1982 and 2002 by 68 faculty members of 18 American Library Association- (ALA-) accredited LIS schools, hundreds of databases were searched. Results show that there are only 10 databases that provide significant coverage of the LIS indexed literature. Results also show that restricting the data sources to one, two, or even three databases leads to inaccurate rankings and erroneous conclusions. Because no database provides comprehensive coverage of the LIS literature, researchers must rely on a wide range of disciplinary and multidisciplinary databases for ranking and other research purposes. The study answers such questions as the following: Is the Association of Library and Information Science Education's (ALISE's) directory of members a reliable tool to identify a complete list of faculty members at LIS schools? How many and which databases are needed in a multifile search to arrive at accurate publication count rankings? What coverage will be achieved using a certain number of databases? Which research areas are well covered by which databases? What alternative methods and tools are available to supplement gaps among databases? Did coverage performance of databases change over time? What counting method should be used when determining what and how many items each LIS faculty and school has published? The authors recommend advanced analysis of research productivity to provide a more detailed assessment of research productivity of authors and programs.",

    "abstract": "The paper discusses the notion of steps in indexing and reveals that the document-centered approach to indexing is prevalent and argues that the document-centered approach is problematic because it blocks out context-dependent factors in the indexing process. A domain-centered approach to indexing is presented as an alternative and the paper discusses how this approach includes a broader range of analyses and how it requires a new set of actions from using this approach; analysis of the domain, users and indexers. The paper concludes that the two-step procedure to indexing is insufficient to explain the indexing process and suggests that the domain-centered approach offers a guide for indexers that can help them manage the complexity of indexing.",

    "abstract": "Current institutional repository software provides few tools to help metadata librarians understand and analyse their collections. In this paper we compare and contrast metadata analysis tools that were developed simultaneously, but independently, at two New Zealand institutions during a period of national investment in research repositories: the Metadata Analysis Tool (MAT) at The University of Waikato, and the Kiwi Research Information Service (KRIS) at the National Library of New Zealand. The tools have many similarities: they are convenient, online, on-demand services that harvest metadata using OAI-PMH, they were developed in response to feedback from repository administrators, and they both help pinpoint specific metadata errors as well as generating summary statistics. They also have significant differences: one is a dedicated tool while the other is part of a wider access tool; one gives a holistic view of the metadata while the other looks for specific problems; one seeks patterns in the data values while the other checks that those values conform to metadata standards. Both tools work in a complementary manner to existing web-based administration tools. We have observed that discovery and correction of metadata errors can be quickly achieved by switching web browser views from the analysis tool to the repository interface, and back. We summarise the findings from both tools' deployment into a checklist of requirements for metadata analysis tools.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Owing to the recent developments in automatic metadata generation and interoperability between digital repositories, the production of metadata is now vastly surpassing manual quality control capabilities. Abandoning quality control altogether is problematic, because low-quality metadata compromise the effectiveness of services that repositories provide to their users. To address this problem, we present a set of scalable quality metrics for metadata based on the Bruce \\& Hillman framework for metadata quality control. We perform three experiments to evaluate our metrics: (1) the degree of correlation between the metrics and manual quality reviews, (2) the discriminatory power between metadata sets and (3) the usefulness of the metrics as low-quality filters. Through statistical analysis, we found that several metrics, especially Text Information Content, correlate well with human evaluation and that the average of all the metrics are roughly as effective as people to flag low-quality instances. The implications of this finding are discussed. Finally, we propose possible applications of the metrics to improve tools for the administration of digital repositories.",

    "abstract": "In current library practice, trained human experts usually carry out document cataloguing and indexing based on a manual approach. With the explosive growth in the number of electronic documents available on the Internet and digital libraries, it is increasingly difficult for library practitioners to categorize both electronic documents and traditional library materials using just a manual approach. To improve the effectiveness and efficiency of document categorization at the library setting, more in-depth studies of using automatic document classification methods to categorize library items are required. Machine learning research has advanced rapidly in recent years. However, applying machine learning techniques to improve library practice is still a relatively unexplored area. This paper illustrates the design and development of a machine learning based automatic document classification system to alleviate the manual categorization problem encountered within the library setting. Two supervised machine learning algorithms have been tested. Our empirical tests show that supervised machine learning algorithms in general, and the k-nearest neighbours (KNN) algorithm in particular, can be used to develop an effective document classification system to enhance current library practice. Moreover, some concrete recommendations regarding how to practically apply the KNN algorithm to develop automatic document classification in a library setting are made. To our best knowledge, this is the first in-depth study of applying the KNN algorithm to automatic document classification based on the widely used LCC classification scheme adopted by many large libraries. 10.1177/0165551507082592",

    "abstract": "This study examines Dublin Core (DC) metadata semantics drawn from the perspectives and experiences of cataloguing and metadata professionals. The study ascertains the extent of difficulty in applying the DC metadata elements encountered by these professionals and examines factors engendering such difficulties during the metadata application process. Comments drawn from the survey participants (n = 141) show that conceptual ambiguities (41\\%) and semantic overlaps (45\\%) of the surveyed DC metadata elements are the most frequently cited factors causing difficulty and confusion, in turn leading to variant interpretations of DC metadata elements. This has the potential to bring forth inconsistent and inaccurate applications and implementation of the DC standard across institutions which can directly affect semantic interoperability across digital repositories. The high degree of difficulty (55.3\\%) engendered by the Relation field indicates that further examination of this element is needed. 10.1177/0165551509337871",

    "abstract": "<i>Practical RDF</i> explains RDF from the ground up, providing real-world examples and descriptions of how the technology is being used in applications like Mozilla, FOAF, and Chandler, as well as infrastructure you can use to build your own applications. This book cuts to the heart of the W3C's often obscure specifications, giving you tools to apply RDF successfully in your own projects. The first part of the book focuses on the RDF specifications. After an introduction to RDF, the book covers the RDF specification documents themselves, including RDF Semantics and Concepts and Abstract Model specifications, RDF constructs, and the RDF Schema. The second section focuses on programming language support, and the tools and utilities that allow developers to review, edit, parse, store, and manipulate RDF/XML. Subsequent sections focus on RDF's data roots, programming and framework support, and practical implementation and use of RDF and RDF/XML. If you want to know how to apply RDF to information processing, <i>Practical RDF</i> is for you. Whether your interests lie in large-scale information aggregation and analysis or in smaller-scale projects like weblog syndication, this book will provide you with a solid foundation for working with RDF.

With universities around the world choosing to make digital versions of their dissertations, theses, project reports, and related files and data sets available online, an overwhelming amount of information is becoming available on almost any particular topic. How will users decide which dissertation, or subsection of a dissertation, to read to get the required information on a particular topic? What kind of services can such digital libraries provide to make knowledge discovery easier? In this paper, we investigate these issues, using as a case study the Networked Digital Library of Theses and Dissertations (NDLTD), a rapidly growing collection that already has about 800,000 Electronic Theses and Dissertations (ETDs) from universities around the world. We propose the design for a scalable, Web Services based tool KDWebS (Knowledge Discovery System based on Web Services), to facilitate automated knowledge discovery in NDLTD. We also provide some preliminary proof of concept results to demonstrate the efficacy of the approach.",

    "abstract": "Latent semantic analysis has been used for several years to improve the performance of document library searches. We show that latent semantic analysis, augmented with a Part-of-Speech Tagger, may be an effective algorithm for classifying a textual document as well. Using Brille's Part-of-Speech Tagger, we truncate the singular value decomposition used in latent semantic analysis to reduce the size of the word-frequency matrix. This method is then tested on a toy problem, and has shown to increase search accuracy. We then relate these results to natural language processing and show that latent semantic analysis can be combined with context free grammars to infer semantic meaning from natural language. English is the natural language currently being used.",

    "abstract": "In spite of its tremendous value, metadata is generally sparse and incomplete, thereby hampering the effectiveness of digital information services. Many of the existing mechanisms for the automated creation of metadata rely primarily on content analysis which can be costly and inefficient. The automatic metadata generation system proposed in this article leverages resource relationships generated from existing metadata as a medium for propagation from metadata-rich to metadata-poor resources. Because of its independence from content analysis, it can be applied to a wide variety of resource media types and is shown to be computationally inexpensive. The proposed method operates through two distinct phases. Occurrence and co-occurrence algorithms first generate an associative network of repository resources leveraging existing repository metadata. Second, using the associative network as a substrate, metadata associated with metadata-rich resources is propagated to metadata-poor resources by means of a discrete-form spreading activation algorithm. This article discusses the general framework for building associative networks, an algorithm for disseminating metadata through such networks, and the results of an experiment and validation of the proposed method using a standard bibliographic dataset.",

    "abstract": "This article describes a model for online consumer health information consisting of five quality criteria constructs. These constructs are grounded in empirical data from the perspectives of the three main sources in the communication process: health information providers, consumers, and intermediaries, such as Web directory creators and librarians, who assist consumers in finding healthcare information. The article also defines five constructs of Web page structural markers that could be used in information quality evaluation and maps these markers to the quality criteria. Findings from correlation analysis and multinomial logistic tests indicate that use of the structural markers depended significantly on the type of Web page and type of information provider. The findings suggest the need to define genre-specific templates for quality evaluation and the need to develop models for an automatic genre-based classification of health information Web pages. In addition, the study showed that consumers may lack the motivation or literacy skills to evaluate the information quality of health Web pages, which suggests the need to develop accessible automatic information quality evaluation tools and ontologies.",

The internet is rapidly becoming the first place for researchers to publish documents, but at present they receive little support in searching, tracking, analyzing or debating concepts in a literature from scholarly perspectives. This paper describes the design rationale and implementation of ScholOnto, an ontology-based digital library server to support scholarly interpretation and discourse. It enables researchers to describe and debate via a semantic network the contributions a document makes, and its relationship to the literature. The paper discusses the computational services that an ontology-based server supports, alternative user interfaces to support interaction with a large semantic network, usability issues associated with knowledge formalization, new work practices that could emerge, and related work. 1 1",

    "abstract": "The semantic Web vision of a \"unifying logical language that enables concepts to be progressively linked into a universal Web\" is part of along lineage of dreams of a universal repository of ideas: from Diderot's universal encyclopedia in the 18th century to Vannevar Bush's Memex at the beginning of the computer age to Ted Nelson's Xanadu in the 1970s. However, the semantic Web's development so far has focused primarily on metadata and carefully designed data structures. To realize Berners-Lee's vision, the semantic Web must capture and represent content created every day by people without special training - such content includes blogs, emails, and discussion groups. Rhizome is an experimental, open source content management framework the author have created that can capture and represent informal, human-authored content in a semantically rich manner. Rhizome aims to help bring about a new kind of commons - one of ideas. This commons wouldn't comprise just a web of interlinked pages of content, as is the current World Wide Web, but a web of relationships between the underlying ideas and distinctions that the content implies: a permanent, universally accessible interlinking of content based on imputed semantics such as concepts, definitions, or structured argumentation.",

Chance connections made between seemingly distinct subareas sometimes turn out to be fruitful. The goal in text mining is to assist in this process by automatically discovering a small set of interesting hypotheses from a suitable text collection. In this report, we present open and closed text mining algorithms that are built within the discovery framework established by Swanson and Smalheiser. Our algorithms represent topics using metadata profiles. When applied to MEDLINE, these are MeSH based profiles. We present experiments that demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithms. Specifically, our algorithms successfully generate ranked term lists where the key terms representing novel relationships between topics are ranked high.",

    "abstract": "With the advent and accessibility of the Internet, artistic and indigenous communities are beginning to realize how digital technologies can be used as a means for documenting and preserving their histories and cultures. However, it is not yet clear what knowledge architectures are most appropriate for creating a digital museum in order to facilitate an effective collection, organization, conservation, and experience of cultural and artistic heritage. In this paper, we discuss the concept of \u201d fluid ontologies,\u201d a novel, dynamic structure for organizing and browsing knowledge in a digital museum. Fluid ontologies are flexible knowledge structures that evolve and adapt to communities' interest based on contextual information articulated by human contributors, curators, and viewers, as well as artificial bots that are able to track interaction histories and infer relationships among knowledge pieces and preferences of viewers. Fluid ontologies allow for a tighter coupling between communities' interests and the browsing structure of a digital museum. We present the key ideas behind the use of fluid ontologies within the context of digital museum design and seminal work in metadata/dynamic ontologies, particularly as it pertains to objects of cultural heritage, and discuss these characteristics in three concrete examples: (1) Village Voice, an online agora that ties together the narratives created by a group of Somali refugees using an iteration of community-designed ontologies, (2) Eventspace, a node-based collaborative archive for design activities, and (3) Tribal Peace, an online digital museum still under construction and evaluation that uses proactive agents to tie distributed Kumeyaay, Luiseno, and Cupeno reservations together in their quest to achieve greater political sovereignty .",

    "abstract": "This article proposes a method that allows a value-based assessment of metadata quality and construction of a baseline quality model. The method is illustrated on a large-scale, aggregated collection of simple Dublin core metadata records. An analysis of the collection suggests that metadata providers and end users may have different value structures for the same metadata. To promote better use of the metadata collection, value models for metadata in the collection should be made transparent to end users and end users should be allowed to participate in content creation and quality control processes.",

Along with some discussion of why and how metadata quality is important, an approach to conceptualizing, measuring, and assessing metadata quality is presented. The approach given in this paper is based on a more general model of information quality (IQ) for many kinds of information beyond just metadata. A key feature of the general model is its ability to condition quality assessments by context of information use, such as the types of activities that use the information, and the typified norms and values of relevant information-using communities. The paper presents a number of statistical characterizations of analyzed samples of metadata from a large corpus built as part of the Institute of Museum and Library Services Digital Collections and Contents (IMLS DCC) project containing OAI-harvested metadata and links these statistical assessments to the quality measures, and interprets them. Finally the paper discusses several approaches to quality improvement for metadata based on the study findings.",

    "abstract": "Biomedical literature databases constitute valuable repositories of up to date scientific knowledge. The development of efficient machine learning methods in order to facilitate the organization of these databases and the extraction of novel biomedical knowledge is becoming increasingly important. Several of these methods require the representation of the documents as vectors of variables forming large multivariate datasets. Since the amount of information contained in different datasets is voluminous, an open issue is to combine information gained from various sources to a concise new dataset, which will efficiently represent the corpus of documents. This paper investigates the use of the multivariate statistical approach, called Non-Linear Canonical Correlation Analysis (NLCCA), for exploiting the correlation among the variables of different document representations and describing the documents with only one new dataset. Experiments with document datasets represented by text words, Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) and Gene Ontology (GO) terms showed the effectiveness of NLCCA.",

    "abstract": "In image retrieval, most systems lack user-centred evaluation since they are assessed by some chosen ground truth dataset. The results reported through precision and recall assessed against the ground truth are thought of as being an acceptable surrogate for the judgment of real users. Much current research focuses on automatically assigning keywords to images for enhancing retrieval effectiveness. However, evaluation methods are usually based on system-level assessment, e.g. classification accuracy based on some chosen ground truth dataset. In this paper, we present a qualitative evaluation methodology for automatic image indexing systems. The automatic indexing task is formulated as one of image annotation, or automatic metadata generation for images. The evaluation is composed of two individual methods. First, the automatic indexing annotation results are assessed by human subjects. Second, the subjects are asked to annotate some chosen images as the test set whose annotations are used as ground truth. Then, the system is tested by the test set whose annotation results are judged against the ground truth. Only one of these methods is reported for most systems on which user-centred evaluation are conducted. We believe that both methods need to be considered for full evaluation. We also provide an example evaluation of our system based on this methodology. According to this study, our proposed evaluation methodology is able to provide deeper understanding of the system's performance.",

    "abstract": "Although the issue of metadata quality is recognized as an important topic within the metadata research community, the cultural heritage sector has been slow to develop methodologies, guidelines and tools for addressing this topic in practice. This paper concentrates on metadata quality specifically within the museum sector and describes the potential of data-profiling techniques for metadata quality evaluation. A case study illustrates the application of a general-purpose data-profiling tool on a large collection of metadata records from an ethnographic collection. After an analysis of the results of the case-study the paper reviews further steps in our research and presents the implementation of a metadata quality tool within an open-source collection management software.",

A multitude of practical and methodic questions rise as popular web-applications such as blogs, RSS and social bookmarking tools allow users to create and share metadata about online resources. This article tackles these issues in the particular domain of visual cultural heritage. Online image databases increasingly offer users possibilities to annotate and comment on images of interest to them. But what is the pertinence of these user contributions? How can their quality be evaluated? Con- cretely, our article starts with an introduction to the phenomenon of user- generated metadata by presenting the social tagging of cultural heritage images and the practice of publishing users comments. Secondly, a case study presents an analysis of users comments within the image database of the National Archives of the Netherlands.

    "abstract": "The Web is ephemeral. Many resources have representations that change overtime, and many of those representations are lost forever. A lucky few manage toreappear as archived resources that carry their own URIs. For example, somecontent management systems maintain version pages that reflect a frozen priorstate of their changing resources. Archives recurrently crawl the web to obtainthe actual representation of resources, and subsequently make those availablevia special-purpose archived resources. In both cases, the archival copies haveURIs that are protocol-wise disconnected from the URI of the resource of whichthey represent a prior state. Indeed, the lack of temporal capabilities in themost common Web protocol, HTTP, prevents getting to an archived resource on thebasis of the URI of its original. This turns accessing archived resources intoa significant discovery challenge for both human and software agents, whichtypically involves following a multitude of links from the original to thearchival resource, or of searching archives for the original URI. This paperproposes the protocol-based Memento solution to address this problem, anddescribes a proof-of-concept experiment that includes major servers of archivalcontent, including Wikipedia and the Internet Archive. The Memento solution isbased on existing HTTP capabilities applied in a novel way to add the temporaldimension. The result is a framework in which archived resources can seamlesslybe reached via the URI of their original: protocol-based time travel for theWeb.",

    "abstract": "The X-Map system for automated semantic correlation between multiple schemas represents a novel perspective for mediating XML data interoperability between multiple heterogeneous systems. Instead of using time consuming data-domain modeling or other pre-constructed knowledge about the systems\\&\\#039; data-domain, X-Map relies on three techniques to do its job, none of which require pre-construction of anything: relevant definition of equivalence and other classes of relations, speculative evaluation of relations between data-domains, and a regenerative association engine to reevaluate speculations. Restriction to valid XML data also gives X-Map some advantage, including well-formedness, parsing, and data element identification. Essentially, X-Map uses the definition of equivalence to plant seeds of possible correlation between schema elements, speculates on the relation\\&\\#039;s correctness, then continuously re-evaluates the correctness of the speculative relations when given additional information from newly introduced schemas. In e\\#ect, X-Map generates and harbors a large growing body of knowledge between the elements of the many schemas that it encounters. Furthermore, this knowledge is store in valid XML format (XLink linkbase and standard valid XML), enabling other XML-compliant applications to perform related mediation tasks such as data transformation and translation.",

    "abstract": "The application of thesauri in networked environments is seriously hampered by the challenges of introducing new concepts and terminology into the formal controlled vocabulary, which is critical for enhancing its retrieval capability. The author describes an automated process of adding new terms to thesauri as entry vocabulary by analyzing the association between words/phrases extracted from bibliographic titles and subject descriptors in the metadata record (subject descriptors are terms assigned from controlled vocabularies of thesauri to describe the subjects of the objects [e.g., books, articles] represented by the metadata records). The investigated approach uses a corpus of metadata for scientific and technical (S\\&T) publications in which the titles contain substantive words for key topics. The three steps of the method are (a) extracting words and phrases from the title field of the metadata; (b) applying a method to identify and select the specific and meaningful keywords based on the associated controlled vocabulary terms from the thesaurus used to catalog the objects; and (c) inserting selected keywords into the thesaurus as new terms (most of them are in hierarchical relationships with the existing concepts), thereby updating the thesaurus with new terminology that is being used in the literature. The effectiveness of the method was demonstrated by an experiment with the Chinese Classification Thesaurus (CCT) and bibliographic data in China Machine-Readable Cataloging Record (MARC) format (CNMARC) provided by Peking University Library. This approach is equally effective in large-scale collections and in other languages.",

It is suggested that these models address issues at various levels of information behaviour and that they can be related by envisaging a `nesting' of models. It is also suggested that, within both information seeking research and information searching research, alternative models address similar issues in related ways and that the models are complementary rather than conflicting. Finally, an alternative, problem-solving model is presented, which, it is suggested, provides a basis for relating the models in appropriate research strategies.",

    "abstract": "Document keyphrases provide a concise summary of a document's content, offering semantic metadata summarizing a document. They can be used in many applications related to knowledge management and text mining, such as automatic text summarization, development of search engines, document clustering, document classification, thesaurus construction, and browsing interfaces. Because only a small portion of documents have keyphrases assigned by authors, and it is time-consuming and costly to manually assign keyphrases to documents, it is necessary to develop an algorithm to automatically generate keyphrases for documents. This paper describes a Keyphrase Identification Program (KIP), which extracts document keyphrases by using prior positive samples of human identified phrases to assign weights to the candidate keyphrases. The logic of our algorithm is: The more keywords a candidate keyphrase contains and the more significant these keywords are, the more likely this candidate phrase is a keyphrase. KIP's learning function can enrich the glossary database by automatically adding new identified keyphrases to the database. KIP's personalization feature will let the user build a glossary database specifically suitable for the area of his/her interest. The evaluation results show that KIP's performance is better than the systems we compared to and that the learning function is effective.",

    "abstract": "The study consisted of two interrelated parts: (1) a quality analysis of the Chinese-language records in the OCLC database, with emphasis on identifying errors in member-contributed records; and (2) the development of a rule-based data validation system for quality control of Chinese-language records in the OCLC database, with emphasis on establishing a set of production rules for such a system. One thousand three hundred six member-contributed Chinese records were randomly selected from the OCLC database and were examined by the researcher. Commonly occurring errors were identified and were categorized into three classes: format errors, content deficiency and inconsistency errors, and typographical errors of editing and inputting. The relationship between the number of times a record had been enhanced and errors still occurring in it was also studied.",

The results show that the model is relatively effective for the task of metadata extraction, especially for theses and dissertations.

The resemblance can be estimated using a fixed size \u201d sketch\u201d for each document. For a large collection of documents (say hundreds of millions) the size of this sketch is of the order of a few hundred bytes per document. However, for efficient large scale web indexing it is not necessary to determine the actual resemblance value: it suffices to determine whether newly encountered documents are duplicates or near-duplicates of documents already indexed. In other words, it suffices to determine whether the resemblance is above a certain threshold. In this talk we show how this determination can be made using a \u201d sample\u201d of less than 50 bytes per document. The basic approach for computing resemblance has two aspects: first, resemblance is expressed as a set (of strings) intersection problem, and second, the relative size of intersections is evaluated by a process of random sampling that can be done independently for each document. The process of estimating the relative size of intersection of sets and the threshold test discussed above can be applied to arbitrary sets, and thus might be of independent interest.

This lack of consistent hampers the information services provided by the {NSDL} to its own web users as well as to aggregators who harvest the {NSDL} data.

The criteria of quality assessment are based on the following areas: consistency, completeness, accuracy and local additions of data providers. This study reports on the results of the tabulations and assessment of metadata quality.

Satisfaction, commitment, group norms are found to have significant impacts on intention to continue using and intention to recommend. Among the three factors, satisfaction has the highest impact on behavioral intentions. Individual-related factors (purposive value and self-discovery) are found to have significant impacts on user satisfaction, while social-related factors are more important in determining commitment and group norms.

Much work has already been done within the learning technology community to assure metadata quality, focused on the development of metadata standards, specifications and vocabularies and their implementation within repositories. The metadata creation process has thus far been largely overlooked. There has been an assumption that metadata creation will be straightforward and that where machines cannot generate metadata effectively, authors of learning materials will be the most appropriate metadata creators. However, repositories are reporting difficulties in obtaining good quality metadata from their contributors, and it is becoming apparent that the issue of metadata creation warrants attention. This paper surveys the growing body of evidence, including three UK-based case studies, scopes the issues surrounding human-generated metadata creation and identifies questions for further investigation.

Whilst the amount of digitised information is constantly increasing, so too is the pace of progress in information technology, resulting in obsolescence of the software and hardware required to access and view digital information. Despite many organisations recognising this threat and the resulting need for preservation action, more work is required to effectively address the issue. We present in this article a framework for the long-term digital preservation of 3-D data. This framework is based on two pertinent preservation practices, emulation and metadata which ensure that the authenticity and usability, respectively, of a preserved digital object remain intact through time. An evaluation of our framework is presented which illustrates the viability of our approach in retaining accessibility, authenticity and usability for future end users.', u'title': u'Long-term digital preservation: preserving authenticity and usability of 3-D data', u'pages': u'33--47', u'citeulike-article-id': u'4217790', u'link': u'http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00799-009-0051-7', 'id': ' citeulike:4217790', u'citeulike-linkout-0': u'http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00799-009-0051-7', u'citeulike-linkout-1': u'http://www.springerlink.com/content/r624114872486937'}, {u'volume': u'24', u'priority': u'2', u'posted-at': u'2009-06-30 16:10:21', u'keyword': u'cidoc, cidoc\\_crm', u'author': u'Martin Doerr', u'year': u'2003', u'abstract': u'This article presents the methodology that has been successfully used over the past seven years by an interdisciplinary team to create the International Committee for Documentation of the International Council of Museums (CIDOC) CONCEPTUAL REFERENCE MODEL (CRM), a high-level ontology to enable information integration for cultural heritage data and their correlation with library and archive information.

A complete and extensible ontology that expresses the basic concepts that are common across a variety of domains and can provide the basis for specialization into domain-specific concepts and vocabularies, is essential for well-defined mappings between domain-specific knowledge representations (i.e., metadata vocabularies) and the subsequent building of a variety of services such as cross-domain searching, browsing, data mining and knowledge extraction. This paper describes the results of a series of three workshops held in 2001 and 2002 which brought together representatives from the cultural heritage and digital library communities with the goal of harmonizing their knowledge perspectives and producing a core ontology. The knowledge perspectives of these two communities were represented by the CIDOC/CRM [31], an ontology for information exchange in the cultural heritage and museum community, and the ABC ontology [33], a model for the exchange and integration of digital library information. This paper describes the mediation process between these two different knowledge biases and the results of this mediation -- the harmonization of the ABC and CIDOC/CRM ontologies, which we believe may provide a useful basis for information integration in the wider scope of the involved communities.', u'title': u'Towards a core ontology for information integration', u'number': u'1', u'citeulike-linkout-1': u'http://journals.tdl.org/jodi/article/download/92/91', u'citeulike-article-id': u'4149301', u'link': u'http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.6.409', 'id': ' citeulike:4149301', u'citeulike-linkout-0': u'http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.6.409', u'journal': u'Journal of Digital Information'}, {u'priority': u'0', u'posted-at': u'2009-12-02 00:29:53', u'keyword': u'metadata', u'author': u'Stephen Downes', 'type': u'article', u'journal': u'Journal of Interactive Media in Education', u'title': u'Resource Profiles', u'number': u'5', u'citeulike-article-id': u'1003673', u'link': u'http://www-jime.open.ac.uk/2004/5/downes-2004-5-disc-t.html', u'year': u'2004', u'citeulike-linkout-0': u'http://www-jime.open.ac.uk/2004/5/downes-2004-5-disc-t.html', 'id': ' citeulike:1003673'}, {u'posted-at': u'2009-06-04 21:08:17', u'keyword': u'digital\\_museum, information\\_visualization, ontology', u'title': u'Creating an Historical Archive Ontology: Guidelines and Evalation', u'author': u'Torou Akrivi Katifori Elena and Vassilakis Costas', u'priority': u'3', u'link': u'http://oceanis.mm.di.uoa.gr/pened/papers/7-onto-meth.pdf', u'year': u'2006', 'type': u'article', 'id': ' unpublished:elenatorou'}, {u'volume': u'25', u'priority': u'2', u'doi': u'10.1080/07317130802127983', u'posted-at': u'2009-07-01 20:54:57', u'keyword': u'metadata, metadata\\_creation', u'author': u'Adonna Fleming and Margaret Mering and Judith A.

As academic libraries begin to digitize objects in their collections, how and who in the library creates access to these resources has become a hot issue. At the University of Nebraska-Lincoln Libraries (UNL Libraries), taskforces were formed to study metadata schemes used at UNL Libraries. The taskforces identified the various metadata schemes in use and the role of various departments within UNL Libraries in the creation of metadata. They made recommendations about how to document decisions relating to metadata and how to coordinate metadata creation and digitization projects. As a result, the authors decided to survey American Research Libraries (ARL) and other peer libraries to determine their metadata workflow.

The ontology is an axiomatic, formal treatment of DLs, which distinguishes it from other approaches that informally define a number of architectural variants. The process of construction of the ontology was guided by 5S, a formal framework for digital libraries. To test its expressibility we have used the ontology to create a taxonomy of DL services and to reason about issues of reusability, extensibility, and composability. Some practical applications of the ontology are also described including: the definition of a digital library services taxonomy, the proposal of a modeling language for digital libraries, and the specification of quality metrics to evaluate digital libraries.

Regarding quality dimensions, we consider: accessibility, accuracy, completeness, composability, conformance, consistency, effectiveness, efficiency, extensibility, pertinence, preservability, relevance, reliability, reusability, significance, similarity, and timeliness. Regarding measurement, we consider characteristics like: response time (with regard to efficiency), cost of migration (with respect to preservability), and number of service failures (to assess reliability).

It can also serve to improve data sharing and exchange. Because the various types of metadata are created in different ways, they can suffer from a problem of inconsistency. Recently, metadata gateway methods have been researched to solve this problem. However, the performance of the existing approaches based on metadata schemas is poor and their maintenance (adaptation of metadata changes) is time consuming. In this paper, a novel message conversion system is proposed, which functions by separating the heterogeneous mapping information from the mapping rules of the metadata, in order to overcome the drawbacks of the existing metadata gateway methods. The proposed system controls the standardized data elements dynamically based on the Metadata Registry (MDR), which is one of the most important elements of the ISO/IEC 11179 standard. The problems associated with adding supplementary metadata are resolved, since the standard provides for incorporating additional data elements created in the future. MSDL is defined as a protocol which can be used for exchanging messages between heterogeneous systems, and which ensures that all of the systems have their own independent metadata schemas. 10.1177/0165551505055403', u'title': u'A message conversion system, XML-based metadata semantics description language and metadata repository', u'number': u'5', u'day': u'1', u'citeulike-article-id': u'6567098', u'link': u'http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0165551505055403', u'pages': u'394--406', 'id': ' citeulike:6567098', u'month': u'October', u'citeulike-linkout-0': u'http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0165551505055403', u'citeulike-linkout-1': u'http://jis.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/31/5/394'}, {u'volume': u'9', u'priority': u'2', u'doi': u'10.1080/19386380903405090', u'posted-at': u'2010-01-16 17:02:49', u'keyword': u'metadata, repository', u'author': u'Jane Greenberg and Hollie C.

Findings: This paper documents the use of unqualified Dublin Core (uDC) elements in the metadata harvested from the repositories participating in the CARL harvester, and identifies patterns in the use of that metadata.

However, analyses reveal some patterns in the use of this metadata that are valuable in the development of best practices for repository implementers. Practical implications: This paper documents the use of uDC elements by a specific community. Its findings will form a basis for developing mechanisms for improving the effectiveness of the metadata generated by that community and therefore the services built around that metadata.

Since users contribute and tag social media content across a variety of social web platforms, creating new knowledge from distributed tag data has become a matter of performing various tasks, including publishing, aggregating, integrating, and republishing tag data. However, there are a number of issues in relation to data sharing and interoperability when processing tag data across heterogeneous tagging platforms. In this paper we introduce a semantic tag model that aims to explicitly offer the necessary structure, semantics and relationships between tags. This approach provides an improved opportunity for representing tag data in the form of reusable constructs at a semantic level.

Ways to bridge this "semantic gap" are increasingly being sought, as our review of the current state-of-the-art reveals. Most importantly though, in this paper we comment on two well-known metadata standards, popular in cultural heritage applications, namely {CIDOC-CRM} and Dublin Core; as diverse their scope may be, we nevertheless show how applications can benefit from a transition to explicit semantic structures in these domains, in a way as painless as possible and conformant to Semantic Web standards.

Ontology development for a specific knowledge domain is however a difficult task, because the produced representation has to be adequately detailed and broad enough at the same time. The CIDOC-CRM is such an ontology, pertaining to cultural heritage, which we align to the Semantic Web environment: first transforming it to OWL and then profiling it not in the usual flat metadata sense, but by refining and extending its conceptual structures, taking advantage of OWL semantics. This kind of profiling maintains applicability of the model, while enabling more expressive reasoning tasks. To this end, we construct a mechanism for acquiring implied and web-distributed information that is used to conduct and present a series of experimental inferences on the CRM profiled form.', u'title': u'Semantic Application Profiles: A Means to Enhance Knowledge Discovery in Domain Metadata Models', u'pages': u'23--33', u'citeulike-article-id': u'6235902', u'link': u'http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-0-387-77745-0_3', u'year': u'2009', 'id': ' citeulike:6235902', u'citeulike-linkout-0': u'http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-0-387-77745-0\\\\_3', u'citeulike-linkout-1': u'http://www.springerlink.com/content/m68460003gu7772p'}, {u'volume': u'13', u'priority': u'2', u'doi': u'10.1007/s00778-003-0105-1', u'posted-at': u'2009-06-30 11:52:57', u'keyword': u'ontology', u'author': u'Latifur Khan and Dennis Mcleod and Eduard Hovy', u'year': u'2004', u'journal': u'The VLDB Journal', u'issn': u'1066-8888', u'publisher': u'Springer-Verlag New York, Inc.', u'number': u'1', u'month': u'January', u'citeulike-article-id': u'1216193', u'link': u'http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00778-003-0105-1', u'address': u'Secaucus, NJ, USA', 'id': ' citeulike:1216193', u'title': u'Retrieval effectiveness of an ontology-based model for information selection', 'type': u'article', u'pages': u'71--85'}, {u'volume': u'25', u'priority': u'2', u'doi': u'10.1007/s10844-005-0188-9', u'posted-at': u'2009-06-30 11:50:38', u'keyword': u'ontology', u'author': u'Latifur Khan and Dennis Mcleod and Eduard Hovy', u'journal': u'Journal of Intelligent Information Systems', u'issn': u'0925-9902', u'publisher': u'Kluwer Academic Publishers', u'number': u'2', u'month': u'September', u'citeulike-article-id': u'328465', u'link': u'http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10844-005-0188-9', u'year': u'2005', 'id': ' citeulike:328465', u'title': u'A Framework for Effective Annotation of Information from Closed Captions Using Ontologies', 'type': u'article', u'pages': u'181--205'}, {u'priority': u'2', u'school': u'Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam', u'posted-at': u'2009-11-25 14:37:08', u'author': u'Michel Klein', 'type': u'phdthesis', u'title': u'Change Management for Distributed Ontologies', u'month': u'August', u'citeulike-article-id': u'4889962', u'link': u'http://www.cs.vu.nl/~mcaklein/thesis/', u'citeulike-linkout-0': u'http://www.cs.vu.nl/~mcaklein/thesis/', 'id': ' citeulike:4889962'}, {u'priority': u'3', u'doi': u'10.1007/978-3-540-75829-7\\_12', u'posted-at': u'2009-09-18 01:08:52', u'keyword': u'information\\_behaviour, model', u'author': u'S.

This study considers a more advanced problem, namely how to discover knowledge not contained in a single source from combined historical facts. By using a well-designed core ontology in the cultural domain (CIDOC CRM, ISO21127), this study discusses the requirement for a robust inference platform for real-life knowledge discovery and integration over distributed sources. The methodology and design are justified in detail through functional requirements for an inference service with the capability of inferring new knowledge from combinations of facts distributed over different sources. A number of critical issues for developing such a robust inference platform are identified, namely (1) systematic accumulation of common concepts and inference rules; (2) extending the ontology with metaclasses; (3) accumulation of factual and categorical knowledge; (4) incorporation of fuzzy inference into the inference engine, and (5) improvement of performance and scalability in the inference engine.', u'title': u'Issues in an inference platform for generating deductive knowledge: a case study in cultural heritage digital libraries using the CIDOC CRM', u'number': u'2', u'month': u'April', u'citeulike-article-id': u'2640808', u'link': u'http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00799-008-0034-0', u'pages': u'115--132', 'id': ' citeulike:2640808', 'type': u'article', u'journal': u'International Journal on Digital Libraries'}, {u'abstract': u'Current data integration approaches by bioinformaticians frequently involve extracting data from a wide variety of public and private data repositories, each with a unique vocabulary and schema, via scripts. These separate data sets must then be normalized through the tedious and lengthy process of resolving naming differences and collecting information into a single view. Attempts to consolidate such diverse data using data warehouses or federated queries add significant complexity and have shown limitations in flexibility. The alternative of complete semantic integration of data requires a massive, sustained effort in mapping data types and maintaining ontologies. We focused instead on creating a data architecture that leverages semantic mapping of experimental metadata, to support the rapid prototyping of scientific discovery applications with the twin goals of reducing architectural complexity while still leveraging semantic technologies to provide flexibility, efficiency and more fully characterized data relationships. A metadata ontology was developed to describe our discovery process. A metadata repository was then created by mapping metadata from existing data sources into this ontology, generating RDF triples to describe the entities. Finally an interface to the repository was designed which provided not only search and browse capabilities but complex query templates that aggregate data from both RDF and RDBMS sources. We describe how this approach (i) allows scientists to discover and link relevant data across diverse data sources and (ii) provides a platform for development of integrative informatics applications. 10.1093/bib/bbp007', u'number': u'2', u'month': u'March', u'citeulike-article-id': u'4199625', u'citeulike-linkout-1': u'http://bib.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/10/2/164?etoc', u'citeulike-linkout-0': u'http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/bib/bbp007', 'id': ' citeulike:4199625', u'citeulike-linkout-2': u'http://view.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19304872', u'citeulike-linkout-3': u'http://www.hubmed.org/display.cgi?uids=19304872', u'author': u'Maurice Manning and Amit Aggarwal and Kevin Gao and Greg Tucker-Kellogg', u'pages': u'164--176', u'priority': u'2', 'type': u'article', u'posted-at': u'2010-01-25 18:46:11', u'journal': u'Brief Bioinform', u'volume': u'10', u'link': u'http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/bib/bbp007', u'day': u'1', u'doi': u'10.1093/bib/bbp007', u'keyword': u'metadata\\_semantics, semantic\\_integration', u'issn': u'1477-4054', u'title': u'Scaling the walls of discovery: using semantic metadata for integrative problem solving'}, {u'volume': u'9', u'priority': u'2', u'doi': u'10.1080/19386380903094977', u'posted-at': u'2010-01-16 17:06:50', u'keyword': u'metadata, survey', u'author': u'Jin Ma', 'type': u'article', u'abstract': u'This study assesses the current metadata practices and trends in Association of Research Libraries (ARL) libraries, based on the survey Metadata conducted in spring 2007 (SPEC Kit 298: Metadata), a collaborative effort with the staff at the ARL.

The technological framework of the Web (URI, HTTP, XML) and of the Semantic Web (RDF, OWL, SPARQL) provides a platform upon which distributed data and metadata applications may be constructed, but does not in itself provide any direct support for information retrieval applications per se. Widely applicable Semantic Web languages that extend this basic layer and provide generic support for retrieval applications, in addition to good practice guidelines and design patterns for developing such applications, are required.The ultimate purpose of this report is to develop a formal theory of retrieval using controlled vocabularies that have a simple and intuitive structure, to provide the necessary theoretical foundations for the development of Semantic Web languages and design patterns for distributed retrieval applications. The main body of this report is devoted to the articulation of such a theory. The theory is expressed formally through the use of mathematical notation, with the intention that this level of formality will provide the bridge between informal requirements specifications and the implementation of effective retrieval applications in computer systems.Specifically, a theory is developed to describe the ways in which a structured vocabulary may be used to construct an index over a collection of objects and then used to express queries which may be evaluated against an index to obtain a set of results. This theory is extended to consider ways in which both the precision and recall of retrieval strategies may be improved, through the use of expansion and ranking techniques and through \u201d coordination\u201d. The problem of translating between controlled vocabularies is also considered. The theory attempts to formalise, unify and extend the traditional wisdom of the library sciences regarding the use of thesauri, classification schemes, subject heading systems, taxonomies and other types of structured vocabulary, so that proven techniques and methodologies may be transferred to a Semantic Web context.The recently chartered W3C Semantic Web Deployment Working Group has been charged with the development of the Simple Knowledge Organisation System (SKOS) to W3C Recommendation status. SKOS is a Semantic Web language specifically intended to support information retrieval applications using controlled vocabularies that have a relatively simple structure. A formal requirements specification is the first planned deliverable in the standardisation of SKOS. An immediate goal of this report is to provide a level of abstraction that can be used to perform a comparative analysis of use cases involving information retrieval systems that operate with structured vocabularies, so that the requirements of these systems with respect to Semantic Web languages such as SKOS may be clearly determined. Also, this report suggests ways in which the theory may be mapped to concrete language constructs and representation patterns in Semantic Web languages. In so doing it is hoped that the development of SKOS and similar languages may be grounded with sufficient rigour to ensure their wide applicability and consistent use.', u'title': u'Retrieval and the Semantic Web: A Theory of Retrieval Using Structured Vocabularies', u'citeulike-article-id': u'2295482', u'link': u'http://isegserv.itd.rl.ac.uk/retrieval/', u'citeulike-linkout-0': u'http://isegserv.itd.rl.ac.uk/retrieval/', 'id': ' citeulike:2295482'}, {u'volume': u'3', u'priority': u'2', u'doi': u'10.1016/j.joi.2008.12.003', u'posted-at': u'2010-01-15 14:03:03', u'keyword': u'digital\\_library, evaluation', u'author': u"B{\\'a}rbara L.

These complexities and dynamics make system maintenance a non-trivial task, since it requires periodical evaluation of the different DL components. Generally, these evaluations are customized per system and are performed only when problems occur and administrator intervention is required. This work aims to change the situation. We present 5SQual, a tool which provides ways to perform automatic and configurable evaluations of some of the most important DL components, among them, digital objects, metadata, and services. The tool implements diverse numeric indicators that are associated with eight quality dimensions described in the 5S quality model. Its generic architecture was developed to be applicable to various DLs and scenarios. In sum, the main contributions of this work include: (i) the design and implementation of 5SQual, a tool that validates a theoretical DL quality model; (ii) the demonstration of the applicability of the tool in several usage scenarios; and (iii) the evaluation (with usability specialists) of its graphical interface specially designed to guide the configuration of 5SQual evaluations.

In doing so, the study identifies both tools and methods that generate more accurate publication count rankings as well as databases that should be taken into consideration when conducting comprehensive searches in the literature for research and curricular needs. With a list of 2,625 items published between 1982 and 2002 by 68 faculty members of 18 American Library Association- (ALA-) accredited LIS schools, hundreds of databases were searched. Results show that there are only 10 databases that provide significant coverage of the LIS indexed literature. Results also show that restricting the data sources to one, two, or even three databases leads to inaccurate rankings and erroneous conclusions. Because no database provides comprehensive coverage of the LIS literature, researchers must rely on a wide range of disciplinary and multidisciplinary databases for ranking and other research purposes. The study answers such questions as the following: Is the Association of Library and Information Science Education's (ALISE's) directory of members a reliable tool to identify a complete list of faculty members at LIS schools? How many and which databases are needed in a multifile search to arrive at accurate publication count rankings? What coverage will be achieved using a certain number of databases? Which research areas are well covered by which databases? What alternative methods and tools are available to supplement gaps among databases? Did coverage performance of databases change over time? What counting method should be used when determining what and how many items each LIS faculty and school has published?

The tools have many similarities: they are convenient, online, on-demand services that harvest metadata using OAI-PMH, they were developed in response to feedback from repository administrators, and they both help pinpoint specific metadata errors as well as generating summary statistics. They also have significant differences: one is a dedicated tool while the other is part of a wider access tool; one gives a holistic view of the metadata while the other looks for specific problems; one seeks patterns in the data values while the other checks that those values conform to metadata standards. Both tools work in a complementary manner to existing web-based administration tools.

Abandoning quality control altogether is problematic, because low-quality metadata compromise the effectiveness of services that repositories provide to their users. To address this problem, we present a set of scalable quality metrics for metadata based on the Bruce \\& Hillman framework for metadata quality control. We perform three experiments to evaluate our metrics: (1) the degree of correlation between the metrics and manual quality reviews, (2) the discriminatory power between metadata sets and (3) the usefulness of the metrics as low-quality filters. Through statistical analysis, we found that several metrics, especially Text Information Content, correlate well with human evaluation and that the average of all the metrics are roughly as effective as people to flag low-quality instances. The implications of this finding are discussed.

With the explosive growth in the number of electronic documents available on the Internet and digital libraries, it is increasingly difficult for library practitioners to categorize both electronic documents and traditional library materials using just a manual approach. To improve the effectiveness and efficiency of document categorization at the library setting, more in-depth studies of using automatic document classification methods to categorize library items are required. Machine learning research has advanced rapidly in recent years. However, applying machine learning techniques to improve library practice is still a relatively unexplored area. This paper illustrates the design and development of a machine learning based automatic document classification system to alleviate the manual categorization problem encountered within the library setting. Two supervised machine learning algorithms have been tested. Our empirical tests show that supervised machine learning algorithms in general, and the k-nearest neighbours (KNN) algorithm in particular, can be used to develop an effective document classification system to enhance current library practice. Moreover, some concrete recommendations regarding how to practically apply the KNN algorithm to develop automatic document classification in a library setting are made. To our best knowledge, this is the first in-depth study of applying the KNN algorithm to automatic document classification based on the widely used LCC classification scheme adopted by many large libraries. 10.1177/0165551507082592', u'title': u'A comparative study of two automatic document classification methods in a library setting', u'number': u'2', u'day': u'1', u'citeulike-article-id': u'6854365', u'link': u'http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0165551507082592', u'pages': u'213--230', 'id': ' citeulike:6854365', u'month': u'April', u'citeulike-linkout-0': u'http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0165551507082592', u'citeulike-linkout-1': u'http://jis.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/34/2/213'}, {u'volume': u'35', u'priority': u'0', u'doi': u'10.1177/0165551509337871', u'posted-at': u'2010-01-15 16:52:46', u'keyword': u'metadata, semantic', u'author': u'Jungran Park and Eric Childress', u'journal': u'Journal of Information Science', 'type': u'article', u'abstract': u'This study examines Dublin Core (DC) metadata semantics drawn from the perspectives and experiences of cataloguing and metadata professionals.

SPARQL contains capabilities for querying required and optional graph patterns along with their conjunctions and disjunctions. SPARQL also supports extensible value testing and constraining queries by source RDF graph. The results of SPARQL queries can be results sets or RDF graphs.', u'title': u'SPARQL Query Language for RDF', 'id': ' citeulike:1453509', u'month': u'January', u'citeulike-article-id': u'1453509', u'link': u'http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-sparql-query/', u'howpublished': u'W3C Recommendation', u'citeulike-linkout-0': u'http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-sparql-query/', u'institution': u'World Wide Web Consortium'}, {u'priority': u'2', u'posted-at': u'2009-06-30 16:19:43', u'keyword': u'semantic\\_web, web\\_services', u'author': u'M.

Many of the existing mechanisms for the automated creation of metadata rely primarily on content analysis which can be costly and inefficient. The automatic metadata generation system proposed in this article leverages resource relationships generated from existing metadata as a medium for propagation from metadata-rich to metadata-poor resources. Because of its independence from content analysis, it can be applied to a wide variety of resource media types and is shown to be computationally inexpensive. The proposed method operates through two distinct phases. Occurrence and co-occurrence algorithms first generate an associative network of repository resources leveraging existing repository metadata. Second, using the associative network as a substrate, metadata associated with metadata-rich resources is propagated to metadata-poor resources by means of a discrete-form spreading activation algorithm. This article discusses the general framework for building associative networks, an algorithm for disseminating metadata through such networks, and the results of an experiment and validation of the proposed method using a standard bibliographic dataset.', u'title': u'Automatic Metadata Generation using Associative Networks', u'month': u'Jun', u'citeulike-article-id': u'2968250', u'eprint': u'0807.0023', u'year': u'2008', u'link': u'http://arxiv.org/abs/0807.0023', u'archiveprefix': u'arXiv', 'type': u'misc', 'id': ' citeulike:2968250'}, {u'volume': u'24', u'priority': u'2', u'doi': u'10.1108/07378830610669547', u'posted-at': u'2010-01-16 01:33:22', u'keyword': u'canada, digital, file-import-10-01-16, libraries', u'author': u'Kathleen Shearer', u'journal': u'Library Hi Tech', 'type': u'article', u'abstract': u'Purpose -- To report the results of the 2005 {CARL} survey of institutional repositories {(IRs)} and discuss some of the challenges of implementing {IRs} in Canada.

The internet is rapidly becoming the first place for researchers to publish documents, but at present they receive little support in searching, tracking, analyzing or debating concepts in a literature from scholarly perspectives. This paper describes the design rationale and implementation of ScholOnto, an ontology-based digital library server to support scholarly interpretation and discourse. It enables researchers to describe and debate via a semantic network the contributions a document makes, and its relationship to the literature. The paper discusses the computational services that an ontology-based server supports, alternative user interfaces to support interaction with a large semantic network, usability issues associated with knowledge formalization, new work practices that could emerge, and related work. 1 1', u'title': u'ScholOnto: an Ontology-Based Digital Library Server for Research Documents and Discourse', 'id': ' citeulike:4149292', u'citeulike-article-id': u'4149292', u'link': u'http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.36.3835', u'citeulike-linkout-0': u'http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.36.3835', u'pages': u'237--248'}, {u'volume': u'50', u'priority': u'0', u'doi': u'10.1002/(SICI)1097-4571(1999)50:12%3C1051::AID-ASI2%3E3.0.CO;2-Z', u'posted-at': u'2009-09-07 02:22:51', u'keyword': u'information\\_science', u'author': u'Tefko Saracevic', u'journal': u'Journal of the American Society for Information Science', 'type': u'article', u'abstract': u'This essay is a personal analysis of information science as a field of scientific inquiry and professional practice that has evolved over the past half-century.

Souzis', u'abstract': u'The semantic Web vision of a "unifying logical language that enables concepts to be progressively linked into a universal Web" is part of along lineage of dreams of a universal repository of ideas: from Diderot\'s universal encyclopedia in the 18th century to Vannevar Bush\'s Memex at the beginning of the computer age to Ted Nelson\'s Xanadu in the 1970s. However, the semantic Web\'s development so far has focused primarily on metadata and carefully designed data structures. To realize Berners-Lee\'s vision, the semantic Web must capture and represent content created every day by people without special training - such content includes blogs, emails, and discussion groups. Rhizome is an experimental, open source content management framework the author have created that can capture and represent informal, human-authored content in a semantically rich manner. Rhizome aims to help bring about a new kind of commons - one of ideas. This commons wouldn\'t comprise just a web of interlinked pages of content, as is the current World Wide Web, but a web of relationships between the underlying ideas and distinctions that the content implies: a permanent, universally accessible interlinking of content based on imputed semantics such as concepts, definitions, or structured argumentation.', u'title': u'Building a semantic wiki', u'number': u'5', u'pages': u'87--91', u'citeulike-article-id': u'559522', u'link': u'http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=1512004', u'year': u'2005', 'id': ' citeulike:559522', 'type': u'article', u'journal': u'Intelligent Systems, IEEE [see also IEEE Intelligent Systems and Their Applications]'}, {u'volume': u'55', u'priority': u'2', u'doi': u'10.1002/asi.10389', u'posted-at': u'2009-06-30 06:52:36', u'keyword': u'text\\_minig', u'author': u'Padmini Srinivasan', u'abstract': u'Hypothesis generation, a crucial initial step for making scientific discoveries, relies on prior knowledge, experience, and intuition.

However, it is not yet clear what knowledge architectures are most appropriate for creating a digital museum in order to facilitate an effective collection, organization, conservation, and experience of cultural and artistic heritage. In this paper, we discuss the concept of \u201d fluid ontologies,\u201d a novel, dynamic structure for organizing and browsing knowledge in a digital museum. Fluid ontologies are flexible knowledge structures that evolve and adapt to communities' interest based on contextual information articulated by human contributors, curators, and viewers, as well as artificial bots that are able to track interaction histories and infer relationships among knowledge pieces and preferences of viewers. Fluid ontologies allow for a tighter coupling between communities' interests and the browsing structure of a digital museum. We present the key ideas behind the use of fluid ontologies within the context of digital museum design and seminal work in metadata/dynamic ontologies, particularly as it pertains to objects of cultural heritage, and discuss these characteristics in three concrete examples: (1) Village Voice, an online agora that ties together the narratives created by a group of Somali refugees using an iteration of community-designed ontologies, (2) Eventspace, a node-based collaborative archive for design activities, and (3) Tribal Peace, an online digital museum still under construction and evaluation that uses proactive agents to tie distributed Kumeyaay, Luiseno, and Cupeno reservations together in their quest to achieve greater political sovereignty .", u'title': u'Fluid ontologies for digital museums', u'number': u'3', u'month': u'May', u'citeulike-article-id': u'4746642', u'link': u'http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00799-004-0105-9', u'pages': u'193--204', u'year': u'2005', 'id': ' citeulike:4746642', 'type': u'article', u'journal': u'International Journal on Digital Libraries'}, {u'volume': u'30', u'priority': u'2', u'doi': u'10.1016/j.lisr.2007.06.006', u'posted-at': u'2009-06-05 14:41:36', u'keyword': u'metadata, quality', u'author': u'Besiki Stvilia and Les Gasser', u'abstract': u'This article proposes a method that allows a value-based assessment of metadata quality and construction of a baseline quality model.

Along with some discussion of why and how metadata quality is important, an approach to conceptualizing, measuring, and assessing metadata quality is presented. The approach given in this paper is based on a more general model of information quality (IQ) for many kinds of information beyond just metadata. A key feature of the general model is its ability to condition quality assessments by context of information use, such as the types of activities that use the information, and the typified norms and values of relevant information-using communities. The paper presents a number of statistical characterizations of analyzed samples of metadata from a large corpus built as part of the Institute of Museum and Library Services Digital Collections and Contents (IMLS DCC) project containing OAI-harvested metadata and links these statistical assessments to the quality measures, and interprets them.

The development of efficient machine learning methods in order to facilitate the organization of these databases and the extraction of novel biomedical knowledge is becoming increasingly important. Several of these methods require the representation of the documents as vectors of variables forming large multivariate datasets. Since the amount of information contained in different datasets is voluminous, an open issue is to combine information gained from various sources to a concise new dataset, which will efficiently represent the corpus of documents. This paper investigates the use of the multivariate statistical approach, called Non-Linear Canonical Correlation Analysis (NLCCA), for exploiting the correlation among the variables of different document representations and describing the documents with only one new dataset.

The results reported through precision and recall assessed against the ground truth are thought of as being an acceptable surrogate for the judgment of real users. Much current research focuses on automatically assigning keywords to images for enhancing retrieval effectiveness. However, evaluation methods are usually based on system-level assessment, e.g. classification accuracy based on some chosen ground truth dataset. In this paper, we present a qualitative evaluation methodology for automatic image indexing systems. The automatic indexing task is formulated as one of image annotation, or automatic metadata generation for images. The evaluation is composed of two individual methods. First, the automatic indexing annotation results are assessed by human subjects. Second, the subjects are asked to annotate some chosen images as the test set whose annotations are used as ground truth. Then, the system is tested by the test set whose annotation results are judged against the ground truth. Only one of these methods is reported for most systems on which user-centred evaluation are conducted. We believe that both methods need to be considered for full evaluation. We also provide an example evaluation of our system based on this methodology.

Archives recurrently crawl the web to obtainthe actual representation of resources, and subsequently make those availablevia special-purpose archived resources. In both cases, the archival copies haveURIs that are protocol-wise disconnected from the URI of the resource of whichthey represent a prior state. Indeed, the lack of temporal capabilities in themost common Web protocol, HTTP, prevents getting to an archived resource on thebasis of the URI of its original. This turns accessing archived resources intoa significant discovery challenge for both human and software agents, whichtypically involves following a multitude of links from the original to thearchival resource, or of searching archives for the original URI.

The author describes an automated process of adding new terms to thesauri as entry vocabulary by analyzing the association between words/phrases extracted from bibliographic titles and subject descriptors in the metadata record (subject descriptors are terms assigned from controlled vocabularies of thesauri to describe the subjects of the objects [e.g., books, articles] represented by the metadata records). The investigated approach uses a corpus of metadata for scientific and technical (S\\&T) publications in which the titles contain substantive words for key topics. The three steps of the method are (a) extracting words and phrases from the title field of the metadata; (b) applying a method to identify and select the specific and meaningful keywords based on the associated controlled vocabulary terms from the thesaurus used to catalog the objects; and (c) inserting selected keywords into the thesaurus as new terms (most of them are in hierarchical relationships with the existing concepts), thereby updating the thesaurus with new terminology that is being used in the literature. The effectiveness of the method was demonstrated by an experiment with the Chinese Classification Thesaurus (CCT) and bibliographic data in China Machine-Readable Cataloging Record (MARC) format (CNMARC) provided by Peking University Library. This approach is equally effective in large-scale collections and in other languages.', u'title': u'Automatic thesaurus development: Term extraction from title metadata', u'year': u'2006', u'number': u'7', u'pages': u'907--920', u'citeulike-article-id': u'4107599', u'link': u'http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/asi.20352', u'address': u'Department of Information Management, Peking University, Beijing 10071, China', 'id': ' citeulike:4107599', 'type': u'article', u'journal': u'Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology'}, {u'volume': u'23', u'priority': u'3', u'doi': u'http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/MIS.2008.53', u'posted-at': u'2009-06-30 05:55:48', u'keyword': u'semantic\\_web, semantics', u'author': u'Yorick Wilks', u'journal': u'IEEE Intelligent Systems', u'publisher': u'IEEE Computer Society', u'number': u'3', 'id': ' citeulike:4926312', u'citeulike-article-id': u'4926312', u'link': u'http://dx.doi.org/http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/MIS.2008.53', u'address': u'Los Alamitos, CA, USA', u'title': u'The Semantic Web: Apotheosis of Annotation, but What Are Its Semantics?', 'type': u'article', u'pages': u'41--49'}, {u'priority': u'3', u'doi': u'10.1108/EUM0000000007145', u'posted-at': u'2009-09-15 23:34:24', u'keyword': u'information\\_behaviour', u'author': u'T.

They can be used in many applications related to knowledge management and text mining, such as automatic text summarization, development of search engines, document clustering, document classification, thesaurus construction, and browsing interfaces. Because only a small portion of documents have keyphrases assigned by authors, and it is time-consuming and costly to manually assign keyphrases to documents, it is necessary to develop an algorithm to automatically generate keyphrases for documents. This paper describes a Keyphrase Identification Program (KIP), which extracts document keyphrases by using prior positive samples of human identified phrases to assign weights to the candidate keyphrases. The logic of our algorithm is: The more keywords a candidate keyphrase contains and the more significant these keywords are, the more likely this candidate phrase is a keyphrase. KIP's learning function can enrich the glossary database by automatically adding new identified keyphrases to the database. KIP's personalization feature will let the user build a glossary database specifically suitable for the area of his/her interest. The evaluation results show that KIP's performance is better than the systems we compared to and that the learning function is effective.", u'title': u'Finding nuggets in documents: A machine learning approach', u'year': u'2006', u'number': u'6', u'pages': u'740--752', u'citeulike-article-id': u'1371245', u'link': u'http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/asi.20341', u'address': u'Information Systems Department, New Jersey Institute of Technology, Newark, NJ 07102', 'id': ' citeulike:1371245', 'type': u'article', u'journal': u'Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology'}, {u'chapter': u'48', u'priority': u'2', u'doi': u'10.1007/11914853\\_48', u'posted-at': u'2010-01-15 17:44:52', u'author': u'{\\"U}mit Yoldas and G{\\\'a}bor Nagyp{\\\'a}l', u'series': u'Lecture Notes in Computer Science', u'abstract': u"Large amounts of data in modern information systems, such as the World Wide Web, require innovative information retrieval techniques to effectively satisfy users' information need.
